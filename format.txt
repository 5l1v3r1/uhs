      "text": "Trouble For Mahama Over Harry Anthony Attipoe … As La Youth Threaten To Vote Against Him If Attipoe Still Stays As GARHC Registrar Oct 20, 2016 tweet \nCoalition of Ga-Dangme Youth has demonstrated through the principal streets of Labadi a suburb of Accra in protest against the entrenched position taken by the transferred Registrar of the Greater Accra Regional House of Chiefs (GARHC), Harry Anthony Attipoe not to respect the transfer order. \nThe youth have thus launched their anger at government for not impressing upon the Regional House of Chief to enforce the transfer arrangement and thus allowing Harry Anthony Attipoe to continue in office. \nThe youth in their demonstration warned government to ensure that Attipoe leave or incur the wrath of the people on December 7. \nThey threaten to vote against the ND and John Mahama if government seats aloft and see Attipoe violates the transfer instruction with impunity. Bearing placards some of which read, “No Transfer, No Vote,” “We Want Attipoe Out,” “Attipoe Stop The Thievery, Leave GA,” “Council Of State Member, Adei Annang, Stay Off Attipoe’s Transfer,” \n“Ndc’S Operation 1.5 million Votes In GA Will Not Materialize If Attipoe Continue To Stay,” the youth accused some government officials of taking interest in the transfer of Attipoe hence their unwillingness to ensure that the proper things are done. \nHarry Anthony Attipoe was transferred per a posting instruction letter dated March 11, 2016 and the office of the President letter dated May 23, 2016. \nAccording to the posting instruction letter Harry Anthony Attipoe is to go to the Volta Regional House of Chiefs to serve as the Registrar and will take over from Mr. Daniel A. Azah, whilst Emmanuel Addoquaye who was serving at the Central Regional House of Chiefs as Assistant Registrar will take over from Attipoe at the Greater Regional House of Chiefs. \nHowever, he has refused to leave post. This development however generated series of petitions from La youth groups and some chiefs within the Region who are calling on him to leave so as to enable the incoming Registrar, Emmanuel Tetteh Addoquaye to take over. \nHowever, a letter from the Ministry of Chieftaincy And Traditional Affairs dated August 12, 2016 after it received series of petition in that regard, the Minister ordered Harry Anthony Attipoe to leave post since his posting to the Volta Region “Still stands.” \n“… You are therefore instructed to write a comprehensive handing-over notes and hand over to Mr Emmanuel Tetteh Addoquaye, Assistant National Registrar by Thursday, 18th August 2016.,” the Minister stated in that letter which wassigned on his behalf by B. A. Adotey, Director PPME/HRM. \nThe said letter also made it clear that, Attipoe’s failure to proceed on his posting to the Volta Regional House of Chiefs will mean vacation of post. \nMeanwhile, the youth are aggrieved at the continue stay of Atttipoe at the GARHC three months on, refusing to go. \nThe angry youth pointed out that they have decided to embark on demonstration because despite several letters affirming the registrars transfer by his sector Minister, the registrar, Harry Anthony Attipoe continues to disrespect his orders. \nAccording to the Ga-Dangme Youth the situation is creating tension within the Ga Dangme area as the youth in the region are unhappy with the development. \nThey accused Harry Anthony Attipoe of trying to hijack the Greater Accra Regional House of Chiefs with his actions. \nBy: Prosper Agbenyega  ",

      "text": "News Nyankpala: Cowpea farmers lament continuous lost in yield Cowpea farmers in the Savannah Ecological Zone of Ghana have expressed concern over the continuous loss of more than 80 per cent of their crop yields annually to the destruction by the ‘Pod-borer’, insect. Oct 20, 2016 tweet \nThe farmers, including those from the Upper East, Upper West, Northern, Volta and Brong Ahafo Regions, have appealed to the government consider supplying them with improved cowpea seed varieties that could withstand the insects. \nThe farmers expressed the concern at Nyankpala in the Tolon District at a day’s sensitisation seminar organised by the West Africa office of the African Agricultural Technology Foundation, in collaboration with the Savannah Agricultural Research Institute and the Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology-Ghana. \nThe seminar was aimed at sensitising the participants on the prospects and benefits of the Pod-borer Resistant Cowpea, and to also create awareness on agricultural biotechnology and its benefits. \nIt was attended by farmers, seed companies, chiefs, regulators, students, agricultural extension officers, agro-dealers and scientists. \nIt was also intended to solicit the support of farmers for the adoption of new varieties of cowpea seeds, showcase the Confined Field Trial site to stakeholders, as well as acquaint participants with the new variety of cowpea seeds. \nMr James Ayamba Anaaba, a chief and farmer from Narango in the Binduri District of the Upper East Region, said he had been cultivating cowpea for more than 26 years and used to grow 100 acres every year, “unfortunately, in 2015 and this year, 2016, I grew only two acres, because the losses are too much to bear”. \nHe said as a result of the situation, his expenditure had risen and at the end of the season some of his properties including animals were sold to be able to repay the bank loan. \nMr Anaaba, who gave out a portion of his land for the demonstration of the Pod-borer resistant cowpea in his district, said there was a vast difference between the new improved cowpea and the existing ones. \nHe appealed to government to support the initiative by the scientists, so that they can produce more seeds for supply to farmers. \nMr Mahama Lansah, a farmer from Damongo in the West Gonja District of the Northern Region, said “after 22 years of work as a cowpea farmer, I have nothing to show, because of the attack by pod-borers”. \nSource: GNA/NewsGhana.com.gh  ",

      "text": "The school at Bormase Siblinor in News  50 am / \nUntil funds are released by the government through the Ghana Education Trust Fund (GETFund) or help comes from elsewhere, school children in Bormase-Siblinor in the Upper Manya Krobo District of the Eastern Region, will continue to study in an uncompleted building and under trees, at the mercy of the rains. \nThey may, perhaps, have to revisit their former days of journeying for two hours to the next town, Sekesua, to attend school again. \nThis is because work on a four-unit GETFund classroom project which started in 2012, and was expected to be completed within 12 months, has come to a standstill as the contractor has abandoned the project due to the lack of funds. \nThe school children are in competition with snakes, goats and fowls for space in the structure. \nAdditionally, the children face health risks from animal droppings and the scorching sun, making the environment not conducive for effective and efficient teaching and learning. \nThe contractor, Mr. Sogbor, confirmed that lack of funds had stalled the project. \nHe said he started the project with his own resource four years ago, but had not been reimbursed for work done so far. \nMr. Sogbor said work on the project had progressed and what was left was roofing, plastering, flooring of the classrooms, fixing of windows and doors and painting. \nThe teachers and pupils have no option than to occupy the uncompleted building for classes which were often disrupted anytime it rained or threatened to rain. \nThose who are unable to get space in the uncompleted building are compelled to learn under trees on the compound. \nStudying under the trees became the only option since the temporary structures built by a concerned citizen Mrs. Mary Ayongo Agbettor in 2006, with bamboo sticks and mud, had collapsed. \nMrs. Agbettor privately established the school for the community and paid the salaries of teachers from her own resources. \nThat had greatly helped the school children who previously, had to trek two hours to the nearby school at Sekesua. \nThe government however took over the school in 2012 and initiated the four unit classroom block and a headmaster’s office with funding from GETFund. \nDue to the nature of the structure, parents now prefer their wards to stay at home until they have turned nine and are capable of undertaking the two hour journey to Sekesua. \nA parent who shared the community’s frustration to The Ghanaian Times, said “The children are very young, so sometimes it takes them more than two hours to reach school due to the long distance to the nearby village. Sometimes, when they get exhausted, they rest under trees before continuing their journey. That is why they normally start school at age nine”. \nIn many urban areas and cities in Ghana, children are sent to school at an early age. This means that by the time they are five or six years, they are already in Class One. The situation seems to be very different in Bormase-Siblinor, a community of predominantly poor peasant farmers.",

      "text": "UNESCO calls for promotion of STEM education in News  48 am / \nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) has urged African countries to promote Science, Technical, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education to speed up the continent’s socio-economic development. \nMr. Tirso Dos Santos, the UNESCO Country Representative in Ghana, said the organisation, being the only specialised UN agency with science as one of its core mandates, realises that promoting STEM and Innovation would require cooperation at various levels. \n“We therefore encourage and pursue sub-regional, regional, south-south and north-south collaboration in order to solve pressing developmental challenges,” Mr. Santos stated in Accra at a Regional Consultative Workshop on Strengthening Cooperation in STEM Education in West Africa. \nThe two-day workshop was organised by UNESCO in collaboration with the Directorate of Technical Cooperation in Africa (DTCA) under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Nigeria and the Ecowas Parliament. \nIt was attended by 35 participants from seven out of the eight countries covered by the UNESCO Multisectoral Office in Abuja. \nThe participating countries include Ghana, Nigeria, Benin, Cote d’Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, and Togo. \nMr. Santos said most countries in West Africa might struggle to attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) unless there was substantial investment in science education, promotion of scientific research, cooperation in education and development of human resource capital in the region. \n“Indeed, in formulating the agenda 2030, science cuts across almost all of the 17 SDGs. \n“Science has therefore, been recognised as being critical to meeting the challenge of sustainable development,” he said. \nHe explained that science was universal and cut across cultural and political borders, stating that “this is in no way to say that humanities or the arts are less important than the sciences”. \n“The point here is that we all need to recognise what science could give to society and to harness that for our own good,” he said. \nHe said STEM education and capacity building should be promoted in low and middle income countries, particularly in cases where a widespread appreciation of the benefits and the resources for STEM education were lacking. \nMr. Santos said: “To reduce the dependence on industrialised nations, we need to be scientifically literate.” \nMr. Mahama Ayariga, Ghana’s Minister of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation, in a speech read on his behalf by Mr. John K. Arthur, a Director at the Ministry, said “although STEM education has become a priority in most parts of the world, sadly we cannot say the same for our sub-region”. \nHe said in Ghana’s case, a report by the National Council for Tertiary Education showed that only 39 per cent of the 127,502 students who were admitted to the eight public universities in the 2012/2013 academic year were admitted to science-related programmes. \nHe said this percentage was below the target of 60 per cent enrolment in science and technology-related disciplines for all universities in Ghana mentioned in the 2010-2020 Education Strategic Plan of the Ministry of Education. \nHe said Ghana had plans and policies in place to ensure that STEM education was supported, adding: however, the sad trend observed is that more and more students are fleeing from the study of science.” \nHajia Khadija Bukar A. Ibrahim, Nigeria’s Minister of State, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Chairperson Presidential Inter-Ministerial Committee on the DTCA, in a speech read on her behalf, said STEM education was essential for accelerating the West Africa sub-region’s growth and development. \nMr. Mohammed Kachallah, Acting Director General, DTCA, Nigeria Ministry of Foreign Affairs, gave an overview on “The Role of Secondary Education in Regional Integration and Development”. \nHe said there was an urgent need for the realignment of the curriculum as well as emphasises on the need to strengthen the teaching of STEM education in Africa. \nDr. Nelson Magbagbeola, Secretary General, ECOWAS Parliament, said in order to ensure a vibrant technology platform through STEM education, ECOWAS member-states must enthrone and sustain a culture of innovation and strengthen intellectual property systems. \nGNA",

      "text": "Give back to your schools —-Old students challenged in Education  45 am / \nOld students must build a culture of relationship with their institutions to support and enhance the institution’s ability to train and educate new students. \nAccording to Joe K. Mensah, Vice President and Country Manager, Kosmos Energy, such a relationship was necessary to encourage the act of giving back by individuals to their alma maters to promote quality education. \nMr. Mensah made these remarks at the 1 st graduation and 4 th matriculation ceremony of Palm Institute of Strategic Leadership in Accra. \nThe event saw 19 students graduate with diploma in Business Administration, Banking Technology and Accounting and Computerised Accounting while 18 students were matriculated. \nMr. Mensah urged the graduands to strive to become agents of change with a commitment to affect the lives of people in their societies and advised them to remain tenacious in the face of challenges that would arise in their determination to achieve their aims. \nMr. Mensah asked them to guard against ‘anxiety after school’ that could distort their determination to succeed. \nDelivering on the state of the institute, Peter Carlos Okantey, Founder, said the institute had received the approval to run two more diploma programmes, Agribusiness and Finance and Procurement and Materials Management, in addition to the three diploma programmes currently run by the school. \nHe said the institute was focused on training students strategically for the Ghanaian and African industries. \nMs. Linda Bortey, in her valedictory message expressed gratitude to the management for dedicating their time and other resources to tutor them and helping them to acquire the requisite skill to better their lives. \nShe pledged the graduands determination to be worthy ambassadors of the institute and use their potentials to contribute positively to the development of the country.",

Be a team player, tolerate the opinions of others and be ready to listen at all times. These will yield money in the long term,” he said. \nDiscipline, hard work and dedication, he noted, was essential in realising their potentials in established ventures and urged them to remain committed to these qualities for the betterment of their lives. \n“You are the architect of your professional career. Actions and attitudes that propel its jeopardy must be abolished from this moment”, he said. \nMr. Omar explained that dreams and objectives, although difficult to achieve, must be chased despite the challenges. \nAmar Deep Singh Hari, Chief Executive Officer, IPMC Ghana Limited, said the college was focused on training and equipping students with the necessary skills that would help them build their own careers. \nThe college, he noted was also on the verge of partnering with other institutions to be able to offer diverse technological training to make them ready for the job market.",

      "text": "CADFUND donates to Odorgonno Basic Model Sch in Education  40 am / \nThe China Africa Development Fund (CADFUND) has donated educational and sports equipment worth GH₵ 8,000 to Odorgonno Model Basic School. \nThe items include story books, pencils, erasers, toys, footballs, basketballs and buckets of oil paint. \nPresenting them, the Vice President of CADFUND, Mr. Zhou Chao said the donation was to support the school to provide quality education to the students. \nAccording to him, as developing countries, China and Ghana were faced with the task of developing domestic economy and improving the standard of living of people especially through education. \nHe said that China had learned that education played an important role in the socio-economic development of a country hence his organisation’s focus on supporting educational institutes. \n“A country’s hope lies in children and children’s hope lies in education,” he said. \nReceiving the items, Mrs. Victoria Gyatsen, headmistress of the school said that CADFUND had supported the school since its establishment in 2009. \nAccording to her, support from the organisation had contributed in the success story of pupils from the school emerging as champions in the boys’ football competition and girls’ netball competition in the Ga Central Municipality. \nShe thanked the organisation for the gesture and cited the lack of furniture and books for the school’s library as a challenge facing the school and appealed for help from other corporate bodies.",

We deliver on our promises,” he said. \nCiting various completed projects in the district, including schools, roads, markets and water facilities, the Vice President said only a good and focused government could deliver such projects to better the lot of the people. \nHe thanked the chiefs and people of the district for their support and urged them to be vigilant against deceitful propaganda by the opposition parties. \n“You vote for development and progress when you vote for the NDC,” he said. \nHe gave the assurance that more projects and development interventions would be advanced to the area in line with the government’s policy of equitable distribution of national resources. \nFrom Diaso, Vice President Amissah-Arthur moved to Ayamfuri where he was mobbed by a large crowd of NDC supporters who chanted party slogans. \nHe urged them to vote massively for President Mahama and the presidential candidate for the area to continue the good works. \nSamuel Ofosu Ampofo, a National Vice Chairman of the NDC urged the people to express appreciation for the rapid development and high number of projects undertaken for the area by voting massively for the NDC.",

      "text": "Police van rams anti-US protesters in Foreign News  35 am / \nA police van has rammed into protesters in the Philippines capital Manila as a demonstration outside the US embassy turned violent. \nFootage showed protesters surrounding the van and hitting it with batons taken from police. The vehicle then drives into the crowd several times, injuring a number of people. \nHundreds had met to demand the US end its military presence in the country. \nPresident Rodrigo Duterte has queried long-standing ties with the US. \nPolice arrested at least 23 people, who threw red paint at them and a member of the US forces at the embassy. \nTear gas was used against the demonstrators, after they broke through a line of riot police. They also took control of the water hose of a fire truck being used to douse them and threw stones at police. \nIt remains unclear how many people were injured by the police van and how serious their injuries are. \nTelevision footage of the incident shows the van driving into people at speed. At one point it knocks over a woman and drags her body along the road. The van brakes and she appears to scramble away. \nRenato Reyes of the left-wing activist group Bayan said at least three people were taken to hospital after being rammed by the van. \n“Even as the president avowed an independent foreign policy, Philippines police forces still act as running dogs of the US,” he said, adding there was “no justification” for the police violence. \nA spokesperson for the US embassy told the BBC it had “seen reports” of injuries, but declined to comment further, directing inquiries to police. \nPresident Duterte is in Beijing, seeking to deepen ties and economic relations with China. Bilateral relations were strained under his predecessor over acrimonious territorial disputes in the South China Sea. \nRelations with the US, a longstanding ally, have deteriorated in recent months over Mr. Duterte’s controversial war on drugs.",

      "text": "Somali militants attack strategic town in African News  33 am / \nThere has been fierce fighting near the Somali capital, Mogadishu, after fighters from the Islamist militant group al-Shabab overran a key town. Reports say at least four policemen and several civilians were killed when militants stormed Afgoye on Tuesday. A spokesman with the African Union mission to Somalia later said the gunmen had been forced out, but this was not confirmed. Witnesses said gunshots could still be heard into the night. The African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) is supporting the Somali government in its fight against al-Shabab. Residents said the attack on Afgoye, 30km (18 miles) from Mogadishu, started when militants detonated a car bomb outside a police post, killing four policemen. People took cover in their homes as fighters appeared in parts of the town and clashed with Somali troops and African Union forces. Police officer Abdukadir Ahmed told AFP news agency that at least 10 people, including civilians, had been killed as well as some of the attackers. Afgoye is considered a strategic town as it sits on one of only two roads into the capital. As the fighting raged, both sides said they had control of the town. AMISOM troops captured Afgoye town in 2012.",

      "text": "Schools urged to involve parents in choosing schools for wards Involve parents in choosing schools and programmes for pupils-GES PRO Oct 20, 2016 tweet \nMr. Anthony Kwaku Amoah, a Public Relations Officer of Ghana Education Service (GES), has urged schools to involve parents in choosing senior high, technical and vocational schools for children. \nSpeaking at a special career guidance session titled, “Knowing Your Personality for a Good Career” for some 100 pupils of Rachel Shiloh Schools Complex, a private basic school in Accra, Mr. Anthony Amoah expressed regret at the way the supposedly interesting exercise of having to place successful candidates of the Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE) into senior high schools has become an event for weeping and mourning by pupils and some parents in recent times. \nAccording to him, until schools fully involve parents in helping pupils to choose their preferred schools and programmes of study, the situation where some parents reject schools and programmes of their wards would continue, adding, “Parents are the major beneficiaries of successful children and so the need to involve them in every stage of child education and training, including choice of schools and programmes of study”. \n“Let me use this time to advise teachers and pupils against the tendency of choosing schools and programmes for pupils without the pupils themselves and parents knowing what exactly happen in such schools. Teachers and parents should assist pupils in all areas of education to prevent the discontent and anxiety that most pupils face”, he said. \nMiss Rosemond Nutifafa Adanuti, a teacher and counsellor with GES, urged schools to continue to help pupils identify and develop their talents, skills and potentialities. \nMiss Adanuti advised the participants to learn the good qualities of teachers for better life, adding, “Observe your teachers well and try to emulate their positive lifestyles. Teachers are role models so listen to them and respect them for your own good in future”. \nMrs. Rachel Shiloh, the proprietress of the school, said that her school, which is within its 15 years of its establishment, has produced pupils who are now students in what she described as, “top senior high schools in the country doing very good courses.” \nShe said she would always engage the services of professionals and resource persons to contribute to the delivery of quality education service to pupils. \nBy Donald Eshun/NewsGhana.com.gh  ",

      "text": "Business Bayport Tanzania celebrates 10th anniversary Bayport Financial Services leading micro-credit service provider in Tanzania celebrates 10 years Having started its first operations in Zambia in 2001, the Bayport Group operations are currently in 7 African countries and 2 in Latin America Oct 20, 2016 tweet \nTanzania’s leading specialist credit provider, Bayport Financial Services (www.BayportFinance.com), has over the last 10 years contributed significantly to improving the lives of thousands of Tanzanians through the provision of credit. \nBayport Tanzania is among ten subsidiaries of the Bayport Group that provides financial solutions to formally and informally employed individuals in emerging markets. The group’s services promote financial inclusion for people who are unable to access traditional banking services or the under-banked. Having started its first operations in Zambia in 2001, the Bayport Group operations are currently in 7 African countries and 2 in Latin America. These countries are Zambia, Uganda, Ghana, Tanzania, Botswana, South Africa, Mozambique, Colombia, and Mexico. \nToday Bayport Group has a loyal customer base of approximately 518 000 customers who regularly and repeatedly access its services. \nAccording to Bayport Tanzania Chief Executive Officer John Mbaga, Bayport disbursed over Tshs 48 billion during the 2015 financial year alone. Bayport is considered one of the ‘large tax payers’ in Tanzania, paying over Tsh 7 billion to the fiscus in 2014. \n“Our desire is to improve the lives of our customers and give them opportunities that will benefit not just them but their children and future generations,” said Mbaga at a media event recently. “We support them by focusing on short-term cash flow relief, which in turn helps families towards increasing and lasting financial wellness.” \nBayport Tanzania was incorporated in 2006. It rapidly became the leading unsecured credit provider to employees in both the public and private sectors. Bayport’s footprint of 83 permanent and 45 mobile branches reaches every region in mainland Tanzania. \nThe company has 300 permanent employees and a network of more than 1 000 sales agents. \n“The jobs we provide have contributed to the reduction of youth unemployment in the country,” said Mbaga. \nAccording to the Integrated Labour Force Survey (ILFS-2014), the unemployment rate in Tanzania stood at 13.70%. \nIn addition to unsecured loans, Bayport’s portfolio includes insurance products such as the Education Protection Policy that covers dependents’ education fees for up to three years in the event of the policy holder’s death. Bayport’s Credit Life policy covers outstanding loan balances should customers be retrenched, become disabled, pass away or contract a dread disease such as cancer. \nBayport recently launched mortgage-type loans that allow customers to own a surveyed plot of land. The product extends Bayport loans to off-payroll borrowers by using the surveyed plot of land as collateral. \nThe jobs we provide have contributed to the reduction of youth unemployment in the country \nCommenting on Bayport’s corporate social responsibility policy, Mbaga said that education is its priority. “Through our ‘Change a Life’ initiative we have been refurbishing classrooms in various schools, donating desks, providing full scholarships for university students and donating books. Since 2006, we have had a direct impact on 1 500 primary and secondary school students.” \nBayport also supports orphaned children. A flagship project is the EOTF-sponsored orphanage whose kindergarten Bayport has upgraded to modern standards. The company’s TSh 200- million investment has resulted in an eco-friendly facility with natural lighting and natural ventilation that caters for 40 children at the EOTF center and 60 more from the neighboring villages. \nReflecting on Bayport’s 10-year journey of business accomplishments in the country, Mbaga said that the company is proud of the growth and maturity it has achieved over the past decade. “We celebrate the opportunity and the ability to impact the lives of our customers, stakeholders, employees and the communities in which we operate.” \nHe noted that the company’s strategic vision and on-the-ground implementation had found favour with investors, among them Swedish investment company AB Kinnevik. In July 2010 the latter invested US$40 million in the Bayport Group to become the single largest institutional shareholder in the company. \nFour months later, Bayport issued its maiden bond in the international debt capital markets, raising a total of US$100 million. \n“In 2016, Bayport Management Ltd closed a $250 million senior debt facility with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), the US government’s development finance institution. The long-term loan will support the group’s financial inclusion and growth agenda across its operations. As a Bayport subsidiary, Bayport Tanzania contributes to the group’s investment profile, and benefits from it,” said Mbaga. \nBayport’s business strategy, according to Mbaga, is based on product diversification and technological innovation with people as the core focus. \nIn step with the group strategy, Bayport Tanzania re-branded its identity in 2015 with a people-centered message, giving the company the opportunity to reposition itself as a financial solutions provider. \n“Our new brand was not developed in isolation. It grew out of our business philosophy – which is called The Bayport Way – and supports it,” explained Mbaga. “The Bayport Way is all about how we treat people, be they employees, customers or investors, and how we add value to their lives.“ \nAs a group, Bayport believes that credit is a powerful enabler when managed responsibly and rolled out effectively. “It never fails to inspire us when we see how our customers put their credit to positive use and drive economic activity that fundamentally improves their lives,” said Mbaga. \nThe CEO thanked Bayport Tanzania’s customers, funders, the government and other stakeholders for the unwavering support that they have given the company over the past 10 years. \n“It has been an exciting journey filled with achievements. Without all our stakeholders, we would not have achieved these great milestones. I assure you that Bayport Tanzania is growing stronger every year. As we march into the next decade, we are determined and committed to achieve even higher standards of excellence in providing our unmatched products and services in Tanzania.” \nSource: NewsGhana.com.gh  ",

      "text": "Headlines EC conducts balloting for parliamentary candidates The Electoral Commission (EC) ,on Thursday, conducted balloting for parliamentary candidates of the 15 participating political parties, with barely 48 days to the December 7 Polls, . Oct 20, 2016 tweet \nSeven of the parties were represented at the EC’s Head Office in Accra for the balloting. These are the National Democratic Congress (NDC), New Patriotic Party (NPP), Progressive People’s Party (PPP), National Democratic Party (NDP), Independent People’s Party (IPP), Great Consolidated Popular Party (GCPP) and the United People’s Party (UPP). \nThe GCPP placed first, followed by the PPP, NDC, UPP and the NPP. The NDP placed sixth followed by the IPP at the close of the balloting for placement on the ballot paper for the election 2016. \nThe rest of the political parties, which were not present at the event, had their positions determined by the manner in which their presidential candidates filed their nomination papers. \nThey are the United Front Party (UFP) which placed eighth followed by the All People’s Congress (APC), Reformed Patriotic Democrat (RPD), United Development System Party (UDSP), Ghana Freedom Party (GFP), Convention People’s Party (CPP), People’s National Convention (PNC) and the Democratic People’s Party (DPP) placing 15th. \nMr Samuel Tettey, the EC Director for Elections, explained that the contest for the positions for the independent candidates would be held throughout the 275 constituencies. \nOn the issue that in the past, presidential and parliamentary candidates usually occupied the same position on the ballot paper, Mr Tettey said, it was a convention that the EC usually used in the past, but it was not backed by any law. \nMr Amadu Sulley, the EC Deputy Commissioner in-charge of Elections, said balloting for positions on the presidential ballot paper had been suspended pending the outcome of legal suits filed against the EC by some presidential aspirants who had been disqualified by the Commission. \nHe said due to the limited amount of time left, the EC would go ahead with the printing of the ballot papers and notice of polls for the parliamentary candidates. \nHe announced that the Inter-Party Advisory Committee (IPAC) would hold its next meeting on Friday, October 28, to deliberate issues pertaining to the December 7 general election. \nMrs Charlotte Osei, the Chairperson of the EC, sat through the session.. \nMr Johnson Asiedu Nketiah, the General Secretary of the NDC, in an interview with the Ghana News Agency, said the number ‘three’ was significant in the divine realm; declaring that it was in line with John 3:16 in the Bible. \nMr John Boadu, the NPP’s National Organiser, and Acting General Secretary, expressed concern over the different placement of presidential and parliamentary candidates on the ballot paper and its impact on the elections. \nHe, however, said he was hopeful that voters would be able distinguish his party’s logo and the pictures attached to the elephant from other political parties.

Most of them were in Tanzanian and in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo),” said Burundian Home Affairs and Civic Education Minister Pascal Barandagiye. \nAccording to him, many Burundian refugees have been coming back home from Tanzania and the DR Congo that are cooperating well with Burundi in terms of repatriation of those refugees. \nBarandagiye said, “The problem we are facing is Rwanda that does not want to cooperate with us (Burundi) for the repatriation of Burundian refugees living in Rwanda.” \nHe added that all mechanisms have been put in place to receive returnees in peace and dignity. \n“We have prepared transit sites that will receive returnees before they reach their home villages,” said Barandagiye. \nHe also announced that UNHCR Assistant High Commissioner for Protection, Volker Türk, is visiting some African Great Lakes countries including Burundi and Rwanda by the end of this month. \nRelations between Burundi and Rwanda have deteriorated after Burundi accused Rwanda of hosting and supporting perpetrators of the May 13, 2015 coup plot against Burundian President Pierre Nkurunziza. \nBurundi has suffered turmoil since April 2015 when President Nkurunziza decided to run his controversial third term in violation of the national constitution and the 2000 Arusha Agreement that ended a decade-long civil war. \nMore than 500 people in Burundi have been killed and the UN Refugee Agency estimates that about 300,000 people fled to neighboring countries mostly Tanzania, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) and Uganda since the outbreak of the crisis.

Oct 20, 2016 tweet \nA total of 833,638 tourist arrivals were recorded in August 2016, compared to 731,248 in the same month of last year, Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) said in its latest update on tourist arrivals in the country. \nThe increase is evident in source regions including the Middle East (55 percent), followed by Asia (37.9 percent), Central and South America (24.9 percent), Europe (22.3 percent) and Australia (12.2 percent). \n“Tourists are finding value for money when they visit South Africa, and the recent arrival figures are a testament of that,” Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom said in response to the figures. \nThe UK was the largest overseas source market for South Africa in August, maintaining the same trend of August 2015. China replaced Italy to become South Africa’s 14th source market. \n“As an industry, we are confident we can increase international tourist arrivals by 50 percent in the next five years through improved market access and innovating marketing ventures. The increase can only bode well for our economy and create much needed jobs for our people,” said Hanekom. Enditem \nSource: Xihua/NewsGhana.com.gh  ",

      "text": "UN Special Rapporteurs urged to intervene to insure safety of Anu Muhammad Oct 20, 2016 human rights defender Mr Anu Muhammad \nMd. Shahriar Alam, \nState Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh. \nFax: +880 2 9562188. \nI am William Nicholas Gomes, Human rights defender and Freelance journalist. \nI am writing to voice my deep concern regarding the death threats against Anu Muhammad. \nAccording to the information received by me, on 13 October 2016, human rights defender Mr Anu Muhammad received two messages on his phone threatening him with death. \nAnu Muhammad is a human rights defender working on environmental issues and is the member-secretary of the National Committee to Protect Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Power and Ports. He is the lead campaigner against the Rampal power plant project in Sundarbans, Khulna, southern Bangladesh. Anu Muhammad believes that the proposed coal-fired power plant project in Rampal would have an adverse and damaging impact on the ecosystem of Sundarbans, which is the world’s largest mangrove forest. \nOn 13 October 2016, Anu Muhammad received two messages on his phone from the same number. The first one was sent at approximately 1 am and stated “Death keeps no calendar, and Ansatullah knows no time!”. The second one was sent at 8.43 pm, when he was on his way to Rampura police station to file a complaint about the first threat. It said “Say ‘yes’ to Rampal, otherwise, you must will be hacked to death incredibly by us!”. The term Ansatullah in the first message appears to refer to Ansarullah, which is an Islamic extremist group in Bangladesh that was responsible for the murder of secular activists, bloggers and publishers. Anu Muhammad has filed a complaint at the Rampura police station. \nI condemn the death threats against Anu Muhammad, as I believe the actions against him to be motivated by his legitimate and peaceful human rights activities in Bangladesh. I am particularly concerned for the safety of Anu Muhammad, given the sharp rise in extreme violence against human rights defenders in Bangladesh. \nI urge the authorities in Bangladesh to: \nCarry out an immediate, thorough and impartial investigation into the death threats against Anu Muhammad, with a view to publishing the results and bringing those responsible to justice in accordance with international standards; \nTake all necessary measures, in consultation with the defender, to guarantee the physical integrity and security of Anu Muhammad; \nGuarantee in all circumstances that all human rights defenders in Bangladesh are able to carry out their legitimate human rights activities without fear of reprisals and free of all restrictions. \n\nI want to inform you that I am also drawing urgent attention of the UN Special Rapporteurs on Freedom of Expression and Opinion, and on the Situation of Human Rights Defenders, calling for their intervention into this matter.",

Earlier in April, the EIU predicted a close win for the NPP. \nThe EIU continued that “Pre-election spending in 2016 will put pressure on the fiscal deficit target set in conjunction with the IMF, although the government will be more successful at resisting large-scale populist spending than in previous election years.” \nThis is not the first time the EIU is predicting the outcome of elections in the country – in February 2012, it predicted a win for the late President Prof. John Evans Mills, unfortunately he died before the elections were held. \nSource: Ghana/StarrFMonline.com/103.5FM/Mohammed Awal  ",

      "text": "Court Asks PPP, EC to File Their Statement of Case Oct 20, 2016 tweet \nThe High court presided over by Justice Eric Kyei-Baffour has warned lawyers of both the Electoral Commission and Progressive People’s Party to file their statements of case simultaneously in the suit seeking judicial review of the disqualification of the PPP’s presidential candidate from the December polls. \nThe court says it will at all times be guided by the timeline as far as election 2016 is concerned. As a result, the court has ordered that the filing be done by Monday October 24, and the parties will return to court the following day to make viva voce (oral submission) after which a date will be set for the judgement of the court. \nThe founder and leader of the Progressive People’s Party, Dr. Papa Kwesi Nduom has stated that he would not give up easily following his disqualification from the presidential race in the upcoming December polls. \nThe party thus sued the EC at the High Court seeking an order of prohibition to restrain the EC from proceeding with balloting for position of presidential candidates for the December 7, elections. \nIt also sought for”…a further order directed against the 1st Respondent in her capacity as Returning Officer for Presidential elections to grant the Applicant the opportunity to amend and alter the one anomaly found in his nomination papers as well as accept his nomination papers as amended or altered to enable him contest as a Presidential Candidate for the 7th December 2016 elections.” \n“And for such order or further as to this Honourable Court may deem fit,” the PPP’s suit added. \nDr Nduom and 11 others were disqualified from the contest by the EC. \nSome of the reasons outlined by the EC that led to the disqualification of the aspirants are filing anomalies including fraudulent signatures, absence of a required number of signatures and improper filling of nomination forms. \nSource: Ghana/StarrFMonline.com/103.5FM/Wilberforce Asare  ",

      "title": "When Maria Grette Meets The Nigerian Who Scammed Her",
      "text": "When Maria Grette Meets The Nigerian Who Scammed Her Oct 20, 2016 tweet \nAn internet romance scam took an unexpected turn, writes Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani. \nWhen Maria Grette first discovered that the 58-year-old Danish man with whom she had fallen in love was actually a 24-year-old Nigerian “419” internet scammer, the 62-year-old Swede was distraught. But, soon, her feelings changed. \n“The most terrible thing was not that he had cheated me, but that he had lost his innocence,” she said.She became consumed with what she describes as “a profound need to make a difference to the people of Nigeria”.Ms Grette’s relationship with Johnny (not his real name) began after an evening of fun and games with her girlfriends, during which they playfully created a profile for her on an online dating website. A few years before, she had gone through a traumatic divorce, and her friends teased her about finally starting a new relationship. But when the fun of creating her profile was over, Ms Grette, who works as an arts teacher, painter and arts therapist, didn’t give much further thought to the website. “I received messages telling me that people had contacted me, but I never looked at them,” she said.Then, one day, she did. \n“I still don’t know why,” she said. “It was like a sudden impulse happening before I could stop it.”That particular message was from a man who described himself as a Dane raised in South Carolina, USA; a civil engineer working on a contract in England; a widower with a son in a Manchester university. “I was caught up by the atmosphere and by something in his words,” she said. The pre-ambleJohnny: “I wish I could see through your eyes and see what you like to see”Maria: “I like to see the truth, and often the truth is more beautiful and greater than people dare to realize”Johnny: “You talk in parable´s. I can´t wait to see you”Maria: “I cant understand how you can think so dedicated of me, when you have never met me. That scares me.”“We spent some time writing, then he called from a UK number.”Ms Grette, who had lived in different countries across Europe, was surprised that she could not place the man’s accent. She mentioned this to him but didn’t give it too much thought. He told her that he was planning for his retirement; had Sweden in mind for a place to settle; owned a house in Denmark inherited from his parents; wanted to leave that to his son, Nick, who was very attached to it, while he looked for a new home for himself in Sweden. \n“I wanted to meet him because I liked him,” she said. “He had a way and a sweetness I had never known in a man before. And he was innocent in a way that puzzled me.” \nMs Grette put all these qualities down to “an old fashioned upbringing and an isolated life – living in hotels and spending his free time on golf courses owing to much travelling”.After three months of communicating, the man agreed to come over and visit her in Sweden. But before that, he and his son needed to make a quick trip to Nigeria for a job interview, he said.Johnny called to let her know that he was at Heathrow Airport. And to say that he had landed in Nigeria. He also got her to speak with Nick. The next phone call was to tell her that he was in a Lagos hospital. \nThey had been mugged, his son shot in the head, and they were without money and papers. \nUnfortunately, his bank did not have a branch in Africa, he added, so it would take time to transfer money from his UK account. Meanwhile, the hospital management was requesting €1000 to proceed with treatment. \nThe request \n“Honey, I am in the hospital right now using the doctor´s laptop to send you this message so you can know my situation. Honey, if Nick dies I will also die with him, I have been crying, I wish I could call you, I wish I never came here, I will never forgive myself for bringing Nick along with me. I will call you with the doctor´s phone and send you an email later if I have the chanse. \n“Honey, I am happy to hear from you and I am still at the hospital. The doctor said we where lucky we where not kidnapped. The bank does not have a location in Africa, so it will take time to get money and the management are requesting 1000 euros to proceed with treatment. Nick is all I have got and I will not forgive myself if anything happens to him. I am confused, and I do not know where to turn at the moment……”“I will never forget how I rushed to the Western Union office, trembling while I did the transfer,” Ms Grette said. \n“All I could think of was to get the two persons in Nigeria out of danger.”The plot developed after that initial transfer. Medical complications called for more money. The doctors demanded more advance fees.Several thousands of euro later, in what she describes as “coming to her senses”, Maria realised that something was amiss. She stopped responding to his messages.Three weeks after her silence, he called her and confessed. He told her that he was not who she thought he was. “I said I already knew that. I asked him to tell me his true identity and he did.”He was a 24-year-old Nigerian “419” scammer. He had finished university two years earlier but had no job. These kind of advance fee frauds are known as 419 scams in Nigeria after the section of the Criminal Code which covers fraud. \nHe further described himself as a “devil” who had wronged “a lovely woman”. \n“He said he had never met anyone like me before, that he had been fighting his feelings for me for a long time. He said his scamming mates had warned him about falling in love with a ‘client’, that he had ignored them because he trusted me and did not want to lose contact with me.” \nThe reveal \nFrom this point on, their communication took a new turn. There were no further requests for cash.“The attraction I started feeling was to the person who was revealing himself to me… It was still him, but with a new name and different age and circumstances,” she said. \nJohnny sent her a photograph of himself, but Maria was not satisfied with that. \n“I wanted to meet him,” she said. “I could not live with this relationship unless it was adjusted to reality in all senses.”Unable to get him a visa to travel to Sweden, she made up her mind to go to Nigeria. \nIn October 2009, Ms Grette travelled to Africa for the first time in her life. \n“When I saw him at the airport in Abuja, tears fell over his face, and I knew I had known him all my life.”Ms Grette described her two weeks in Nigeria as blissful, a period during which she and Johnny succeeded in transforming their romantic feelings for each other into a good friendship. \nShe met his friends, many of whom were also scammers. It was while enjoying their company one night in a local bar that she began to wonder how she could make a difference.“I asked myself what I could do to prevent a situation where healthy, good young men fall into this trap,” she said.An idea came to her two years later, in 2011, after she saw an article on a Nigerian news website about an arts exhibition.Over the past six years, Ms Grette has arranged for a number of African artists to visit Europe for arts exhibitions, workshops, conferences and competitions. \nShe has assisted them to source international grants and other funding to advance their work.She has also visited Uganda to give talks on art, and is looking forward to another visit to Nigeria scheduled for later this year. \nMs Grette, now 69 and living in Norway, is elated at the opportunity to improve the lives of these young artists.“Johnny has given me more than he took,” she said, “Without him, I would not have met Africa.” \nWhen she’d visited him in Abuja, Johnny promised Ms Grette that he would give up scamming. With her assistance, he left Nigeria shortly afterwards, to study in America. \nAlthough they have not met each other again since, she continued to provide him with financial assistance until he completed his degree a few years ago and got a job in the American oil sector. \nThey still communicate frequently, updating themselves on each other’s lives; and last year, he bought one of her paintings which she shipped over to him in America. \n“He is very dear to me,” she said. “He has asked me so many times to forgive him and I told him that the most important thing is to forgive himself.” \nSource : BBC  ",

I think I also like Stonebwoy and my kids like Shatta Wale, we enjoy Kakai”. \nShe went on to tip songstress, Becca, as her all-time Ghanaian musician. \nShe was voted into office during the December 7, 2012 elections. She has promised to double her votes in the December 7 elections and urged Ghanaians to vote massively for her and the NPP’s flag bearer, Nana Akufo-Addo, who is in the race for the Flagstaff House for the third time running. \nSource: Ghana/StarrFMonline.com/103.5FM/Miriam Hayford Do you have more to share about this story - photos or video etc - you can send them to: (newsghana101@gmail.com) TAGS",

      "text": "NPP: Debrah Must Apologise for Careless Kalyppo Comment Oct 20, 2016 \nThe Chief of Staff Julius Debrah must withdraw and apologise over his recent comment asking adults to stay away from local fruit juice Kalyppo, an offshoot of the opposition New Patriotic Party (NPP) has said. \nThe Truth Forum described Mr. Debrah’s statement as “irresponsible” and aimed at killing local businesses. \n“This brings back memories of terror on private entrepreneurship; and as a people, we must condemn such utterances in our political discourse. \n“We are therefore calling on Mr. Julius Debrah to apologise for the irresponsible statement, and also to the manufacturers of Kalyppo and the general public,” a statement signed by Anthony Karbo, a member of the Truth Forum and a communication member of the NPP said. \nBelow is the full statement: \nNDC ATTACKS LOCAL INDUSTRY The Truth Forum, condemns the reckless and irresponsible pronouncements made by the Chief of Staff, Mr Julius Debrah, urging Ghanaians to stay away from Kalyppo, a locally-made fruit juice. \nIt is rather unfortunate that, after 8years of making a complete mess of the Ghanaian economy, the John Mahama-led NDC government has decided to not only negatively tag our local industry, but take us back to the dark days in our history. \nIt will be recalled that a few weeks ago, the flagbearer of the New Patriotic Party, Nana Akufo-Addo, was spotted in photograph drinking Kalyppo fruit juice. The photograph went viral on social media, with Ghanaians from all walks of life identifying with him by posting selfies mimicking him drinking the locally made juice. It is obvious that sales of Kalyppo has increased tremendously in recent times. \nSpeaking to supporters of the governing National Democratic Congress (NDC) in the Brong Ahafo Regional town of Wenchi, Mr. Debrah said “adults who take very sweet fruit juices would go down with a sickness called “Kalyppolities.” The Chief of Staff has suddenly acquired medical qualification to determine what our population should or should not consume. \nAfter presiding over several years of unending power crisis, high taxes, petroleum price hikes, high utility tariffs, mismanagement of the economy, unstable currency which has resulted in collapse of many businesses and rendering hundreds of thousands of Ghanaians jobless, it is regrettable that such comments would come from the Chief of staff. Instead of outlining what has been done to curtail the energy crisis in the long-term, as well as measures put in place to make the business environment conducive for business to thrive, this is how low government has decided to sink. \nThis brings back memories of terror on private entrepreneurship; and as a people, we must condemn such utterances in our political discourse. \nWe are therefore calling on Mr. Julius Debrah to apologise for the irresponsible statement, and also to the manufacturers of Kalyppo and the general public. \nSigned………….",

      "text": "NPP’s ‘1-District-1-Factory’ Has No Substance – Ahwoi Oct 20, 2016 tweet \nLocal government expert and a founding member of the National Democratic Congress Prof. Kwamena Ahwoi argues the NPP’s proposal of ‘One Factory-One District’ is not feasible. \nAccording to him, the extension of electricity, water, building of roads, schools, and hospitals are necessary foundations for the building of a workable system of factories. \n“Without roads, electricity, water and all that President Mahama is building across the country how would factories work?” Prof. Ahwoi quizzed. \nAgain he wondered how the proposal would be executed in reality when places like Tema already have over 400 factories. \n“Does that mean Tema will receive a factory too?” the veteran politician queried. \nSpeaking at the NDC’s campaign rally in Brosankro in the Tano South constituency of the Brong Ahafo region the seasoned academic and politician also questioned the New Patriotic Party’s basis for criticising the NDC’s appointment of young people into government. \nHe referred the teeming crowd to history when Dr Kwame Nkrumah, President JJ Rawlings and even himself were at the helm of national affairs at their youth. “It is therefore unfounded for them to keep looking down on the NDC for being a youthful party,” Prof. Ahwoi noted. \nHe appealed to the supporters to vote massively for Mahama come the December 7 elections. \nSource: Ghana/starrfmonline.com/103.5FM/Kingsley Lakle/Freelancer Do you have more to share about this story - photos or video etc - you can send them to: (newsghana101@gmail.com) TAGS",

      "text": "Zidan Promises to Beat Ghana Without Mercy Oct 20, 2016 tweet \nEgypt’s striker Mohamed Zidan has expressed his satisfaction with the 2017 AFCON Draw as the Pharaohs fell in Group D with Ghana again. \nThe former Borussia Dortmund forward believes the Black Stars will be beaten on November 13 in the World Cup qualifier and will then go ahead next year to repeat the same feat in Gabon. \n“Falling in the same group as Ghana and Uganda is beneficial to us. Beating them in the World Cup Qualifiers will earn the players more confidence to beat them again in the AFCON,” Zidan told DMC sports channel. \n“Mali is a strong team. This generation of Egyptian footballers went through a lot of obstacles like the absence of the fans from Stadiums. However, we passed all these difficulties and the next period will be a great one for Egyptian football,” he added. \n“Comparing this generation to the past ones makes things harder for them. For instance, in 2010 we won against Ghana in the AFCON final with experience and self confidence, although they were physically way better than us,” he continued. \nHe emphasized the importance of winning against the Black Stars in the World Cup Qualifiers. \n“Our current National team is gaining experience gradually. A win against Ghana in the World Cup qualifiers is easy and important to widen the gap to five points,” he concluded. \nSource:Ghana/starrfmonline.com/103.5FM/Tony Bebli Do you have more to share about this story - photos or video etc - you can send them to: (newsghana101@gmail.com) TAGS",

      "text": "US election: Trump says he will accept election results provided he wins Oct 20, 2016 tweet \nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump has said he will accept the results of the US election “if I win”.He added that he would accept a “clear” result – but reserved the right to challenge a “questionable” result. \nHe appeared at a rally in Delaware, Ohio, speaking for the first time since the third televised debate with Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. Mr Trump has been heavily criticised for suggesting that he might not accept the election result. \nPolls suggest Mrs Clinton is ahead nationally and in key battleground states. \nWhen moderator Chris Wallace asked Mr Trump during Wednesday night’s debate if he would accept losing to Mrs Clinton, Mr Trump said he would “keep you in suspense”. \nMr Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, later insisted that the candidate had meant he would not concede until the “results are actually known”. \nThe remark, which drew anger from some Republicans, is part of Mr Trump’s repeated claim that the election is “rigged” against him. \nMr Trump told the Ohio audience that the election was posing questions about “the fairness of our country”.“I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States, that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election – if I win,” he said, grinning. \nHe also said: “I will accept a clear election result, but I will also reserve my right to contest and file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result.” \nThursday also saw former Republican presidential candidate Senator John McCain release a statement implicitly criticising Mr Trump’s debate comments. \nMr McCain, who lost to Barack Obama eight years ago, said: “I didn’t like the outcome of the 2008 election. But I had a duty to concede, and I did so without reluctance. \n“A concession isn’t just an exercise in graciousness. It is an act of respect for the will of the American people, a respect that is every American leader’s first responsibility.”‘Lock her up’At the Ohio rally, Mr Trump also reiterated a claim he made during the debate against Mrs Clinton and President Obama, who he said were responsible for inciting violence at a Chicago rally earlier this year. \nThe crowd erupted into cheers of: “Lock her up!” \nMr Trump has trailed Mrs Clinton in the polls after facing damaging fallout over a video that emerged of him making obscene remarks about groping women. \nWhen asked to address the allegations made against him by several women in the wake of the video, Mr Trump said the claims had been “largely debunked”. \nThe two candidates are scheduled to appear at a charity dinner on Thursday night in New York. \nSource : BBC  ",

What we said was that because of our perceived association with the Danqua-Busia-Dombo tradition people tend to think that we support the NPP. So we only told Akufo-Addo to help fix our roads if he becomes President,” he explained. \nMeanwhile, the Catholic Bishops Conferenec has in a statement urged chiefs to desist from politics. \n“We entreat our kings and chiefs to protect the integrity of their stools and skins by refraining from meddling in partisan politics to the displeasure of their subjects as if to say that the party they associate with or endorse is representative of their subjects’ choice as well. \n“Politicians and traditional leaders must work to foster peace and seek the integral development of Ghanaians rather than to divide them,” the statement said \nSource:StarrFMonline.com/103.5FM/Kwame Danso Acheampong  ",

      "text": "CCTV Footage Shows Gang Of Thieves In and Out of Kim K’s Apartment   first images of five suspects said to have robbed Kim Kardashian of jewellery in Paris have today emerged in France. \nFrench media has published footage of the alleged gang leaving and arriving at the reality TV star’s VIP apartment on October 3. \nShot on a private camera just around the corner from the so-called ‘Hotel de Pourtales’ apartment block they are in black and white. \nThey are also so grainy that it is impossible to make out a single face, with detectives admitting they are still baffled as to who they are. \nThe camera footage, released in an online exclusive by the M6 news channel, starts at 2.19am, and shows three men wearing reflective jackets cycling towards the block, and shortly afterwards two others walk past on foot. \nA full 49 minutes then goes by, before members of the gang are seen leaving – a time period that makes a mockery of previous claims that they only spent a few minutes in the building. \nAll have their faces hidden by a combination of hoods and balaclavas, and are thought to be pretending to be plain-clothes policemen. \nTwo of them head up to Ms Kardashian’s first floor apartment with the only security guard in the building. \nThe guard, identified only as Abdulrahman, a 39-year-old Algerian national, has since confirmed the descriptions of the five criminals, saying how easy it was for them to get in. \n‘There was no real security at all. It’s a choice. The hotel doesn’t mind about security,’ said Abdulrahman. \nWhen the men leave at 3.07am they can be seen walking and cycling briskly, and all look very relaxed. \nDespite the CCTV, after more than two weeks the detectives are no closer to catching those responsible for the heist, in which Ms Kardashian says she had a gun pointed to her head, and was tied up and gagged, along with Abdulrahman. \nThe multimillionaire, who was in the French capital for Paris Fashion Week, was locked in a bathroom while robbers stole a $4.5 million ring and a case of jewellery valued at $5.6 million. \nMs Kardashian has, meanwhile, said she is prepared to return to France if summoned by a judge leading the investigation. \nThe 35-year-old left the country within a few hours crime, but Jean Veil, the barrister acting for her in Paris, said ‘she is very calm and very determined over a matter that was particularly violent’. \nMr Veil has hit out at those who say the entire robbery was a set up aimed at attracting publicity. \nThe five men thought to have been involved in the robbery face charges of ‘armed robbery by an organised gang, criminal conspiracy and kidnapping’. \nSource: Daily Mail-UK  ",

      "text": "Election 2016: Debrah Calls For Violence Free Elections   Chief of Staff Julius Debrah has reiterated the need for the youth to desist from acts that could threaten the peace, security and unity in Ghana, especially during and after the December 7 general elections. \nSpeaking at Tanoso South during a campaign tour of the Brong Ahafo Region, he said it does not pay for any individual or group of persons to compromise the serenity and cohesion being enjoyed in the country. \nThe Chief of Staff indicated that democracy is not warfare but an opportunity for people to speak their minds on pertinent issues in the country, thus the need to stay peaceful and united for a progressive course. \n“As we have come to see you sing, clap and energized, it’s healthy. I am the President’s Chief of Staff, when I wake up in the morning I don’t go to the President’s house to say let me enjoy the food that your wife had prepared. \n“The same way when you in this area and you follow a political party and you engage in violence and got yourself maimed, you couldn’t go to the party in future and say, I was the one who was maimed with a knife so give me food to eat,” Mr Debrah said. \nHe thus pleaded with the chiefs and people of Tonoso South to allow brotherly love to prevail at all times to pave the way for progress and development. \nMr Debrah noted President John Mahama has a lot of plans for the people of the Brong Ahafo region hence it will be suicidal for any of the people to plunge the area into chaos, saying , “if that happens development in the area would stall”. \nHe added: “The president who happens to be your in law is a honest and credible man who has the country’s forward march at heart, and will do anything to fulfill the social contract he has signed with you”. \nHe advised that “if they provoke you ignore them and let them take their fight to the bush to fight the elephant, the umbrella family doesn’t fight for political expediency.” \nThe Chief of Staff is in the Brong Ahafo region in the company of other leading members of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) campaign team: Madam Faustina Nelson, Professor Kwamena Ahwoi and Mr. Kofi Totobi Quakye. \nThey have visited Chiraa, Bonsakro and other communities in the week-long tour urging the chiefs and people to vote massively for President Jon Mahama and the aspiring members of parliament in the region to guarantee accelerated development. \nHe indicated that it was important for the chiefs and people to demonstrate their love for the First Lady, Mrs Lordina Mahama, who is a native of the area, by voting massively for President Mahama, to enable him double up the socio-economic development of the area. \nSource: Ghana/Starrfmonline.com/103.5FM  ",

      "text": "ACEP Urge Ghanaians to Monitor The Usage of Oil Revenue Oct 20, 2016 tweet \nGhanaians are being urged to show more interest in how revenue from the oil and gas industry is utilised for development purposes. \nOver the past five years, oil revenue has contributed more than 75 percent to government’s expenditure. But most people, especially those in the areas where the exploration activities take place say the money is not being utilized properly. \nSpeaking Thursday during the Voter’s Compass — a segment on Morning Starr on Starr 103.5FM sponsored by Penplusbyte and the United States Embassy in Ghana, Dr. Ishmael Ackah, Head of Policy at the Africa Centre for Energy Policy (ACEP), said it was welcoming for citizens to demand accountability regarding how the monies accrued from the country’s oil and gas industry are being spent. \nOil and Gas, he said have become important aspect of “our economy” but there is an urgent need to ensure that as a nation, “we don’t depend” solely on revenues from the industry. \nEfforts, he said must be made to diversify the economy using the oil and gas resources of the country as a catalyst. \n“We all have to support,” stated Dr. Ackah. \n ",

      "text": "NDC, CPP Aspirants Say Effia MP is Incompetent Oct 20, 2016 tweet \nThe parliamentary aspirants of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) and the Convention People’s Party (CPP) in the Effia constituency – Michael Otu and Elder Isaac Badu – have launched a scathing criticism on the records of the incumbent MP of the area Joseph Cudjoe, accusing him of “gross incompetence”. \nAccording to them, the incumbent MP has woefully underperformed thus the need to ditch him for a more competent individual. \nSpeaking during Starr Voters’ Voice Thursday, Mr. Otu stated even though the constituency has consistently voted for the NPP, the party deserted it during the erstwhile Kufuor administration. \nThis, he said, was as a result of gross incompetence from the incumbent MP and his predecessors. He said the few developments currently visible in the constituency was the initiative of President John Mahama. \nHe continued that owing to the level of impoverishment in the area, the incumbent MP has no business seeking for another term come the December 7, 2016 elections. \nIn reaction, Mr. Cudjoe urged the constituents to ignore what he described as “misleading statement” from a bunch of “ignoramus.” \nHe said claims of despondency in the constituency are nothing, but misguided propaganda, stating that his achievements are undoubtedly matchless and ubiquitous. \nThe Starr Voters’ Voice is a programme under the auspices of the EIB Election Hub and powered by Penplusbyte and the United States Embassy in Ghana. \nDuring the questions and answer session, the constituents sided with the concerns of the aspirants of the NDC and CPP. They accused their MP of misappropriation of the MPs Common Fund—an assertion the MP branded as “part of the wild propaganda.” \n ",

Oct 21, 2016 tweet \nSan Francisco Police Department (SFPD) initially posted messages on Twitter social network that its bomb squad was on the scene assisting the probe after receiving notification of a vehicle, and public is advised to shelter in place. \nHowever, at about 2:30 p.m. local time, SFPD said the scene near the city’s Hall of Justice was safe and streets would reopen in the area. \nABC7 News showed video footage of a robot apparently trying to open the vehicle’s trunk, and a source told the ABC network local affiliate that the car had a note on a window claiming there was a bomb. \nThe car was in a tow yard underneath Highway 80, which has heavy traffic most time of the day heading into San Francisco or out toward the East Bay city of Oakland across the historic Bay Bridge. \nAmong locations closed as a precaution was the Hall of Justice, which serves as SFPD’s operational headquarters, the main San Francisco County Jail, as well as base of operations and headquarters for the San Francisco Sheriff’s Department, and garage for the majority of SFPD vehicles. The building was evacuated and court cancelled. \nSFPD spokeswoman Officer Giselle Talkoff talked with media but did not provide details. \n ",

Oct 21, 2016 tweet \nThe general command of the Syrian army said the Turkish airstrikes on towns and villages in the northern countryside of Aleppo had targeted “innocent people” and constituted a “dangerous development that will further complicate the situation.” \nA general view taken with a drone shows a mosque where forces loyal to Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad are stationed in Aleppo’s government-controlled area of al-Masharqa, Syria October 20, 2016. [Photo/Agencies] Meanwhile, the army threatened to down any Turkish plane that would violate the Syrian airspace. \n“Any further violation to the Syrian airspace by the Turkish warplanes will be dealt with by downing them with all possible means,” the statement said. \nThe Turkish air forces and tanks have been backing several rebel groups in an operation dubbed the Euphrates Shield, which aims primarily at thwarting the advance of the Kurdish forces near the Turkish borders, and dislodge the Islamic State (IS) group from the areas they hold in northern Syria. \n ",

Oct 21, 2016 tweet \nBetween Oct. 11-14, the dialogue was convened in Conakry, capital of Republic of Guinea by mediators, during which the country’s political rivals agreed to allow Prime Minister Baciro Dja to stay on until 2018 as a step forward in talks to end more than a year of infighting. \nIn May this year, President of Guinea-Bissau Jose Mario Vaz named Baciro Dja as the country’s prime minister. The appointment triggered immediate opposition from the ruling African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC). \nIn a statement issued here, the 15-nation council welcomed the initiative, which is part of a roadmap agreed last month to end the political crisis in the West African country. \nThe council members said they support the consensus reached on the process for the nomination of a new prime minister and for the formation of an inclusive government in accordance with the agreement. \nGuinea-Bissau has been unstable as the country has witnessed several coups since 1980.

Oct 21, 2016 tweet \nGhana Ambassador to AU Albert Yankey said at the donating ceremony that the money will strengthen the WFP program in the fight against malnutrition, and develop school feeding program for refugees in the region. \nYankey, who conducted a humanitarian assessment mission to Bagassola, in the region of the Lake Chad Basin, said he understood the value and importance of the assistance provided by WFP and other UN agencies to displaced persons and refugees. \nIn this region of Chad which borders Niger, Nigeria and Cameroon, and has been struck by the atrocities of the Nigerian terrorist sect Boko Haram, WFP had set up in January 2015 an emergency operation which has provided a food and nutrition assistance to 130,000 displaced people and about 6,500 Nigerian refugees. \nAccording to Deputy Director of WFP in Chad, Issa Sanogo, the demand is enormous in the field, but there is a shortage of finance.

      "text": "Nigeria 3,000 illegal residents apprehended in Nigeria Operatives of the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) on Thursday arrested over 3,000 suspected illegal foreign immigrants in Lagos, the nation's economic hub, in several raids, an NIS source said. Oct 21, 2016 tweet \nThe early morning raids saw about 40 heavily armed officers combing motor parks, kiosks, hotels and some relaxation centers known to be frequented by the foreigners. \nDuring the raids, the NIS officers shot intermittently into the air as some immigrants took to their heels in the midst of the pandemonium. \nMany of the arrested aliens were from countries such as Ghana, Benin Republic, Niger, Mali, Cote d’Ivoire and Togo. \nAn immigration source told Xinhua that the arrests of the suspected illegal aliens must have been sparked off by growing speculations that majority of the illegal aliens might actually be members of the outlawed Boko Haram sect. \nThe source said the arrested aliens would be thoroughly and methodically screened and those who have valid papers would be released while others would be deported.

      "text": "News Ghana: state prosecutors commence strike over wages State attorneys in Ghana declared Thursday an indefinite strike over government's inability to resolve outstanding issues on their salaries. Oct 21, 2016 tweet \nNational president of the Association of State Attorneys (ASA), Francisca Tete-Mensah, confirmed here that they were demanding payment of arrears and provision of some office equipment. \n“This is a total strike where members will stay at home and not go to work,” Tete-Mensah said. \nThe group last week issued a seven-day ultimatum for the enforcement of an order to harmonize their salaries with that of members of the lower bench. \nThe National Labor Commission (NLC) last week attempted to resolve the impasse between the government and the state lawyers but failed to arrive at an amicable resolution. \nThe attorneys expressed their displeasure at the government’s failure to comply with the NLC’s Compulsory Arbitration Award in Sept. 28, 2015, which is aimed at improving salaries and conditions of service of state attorneys. \nMeanwhile, the country’s Employment and Labor Relations Minister Haruna Iddrisu is expected to meet the state attorneys to find an end to the strike. \nState attorneys, numbering about 150, in July 2015 declared an indefinite strike action over poor conditions of service.

Oct 21, 2016 tweet \nThe orphans were drawn from camps in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states. \nThe gesture was to assist in educating the unaccompanied children living in various Internally displaced persons (IDPs) camps in the three states, Sheikh Arif Zabaden, head of the Abdul-Lateef Zabaden Orphanage in Maiduguri, capital of Borno State, said while presenting the scholarship through Adamawa government at a ceremony on Thursday in Yola. \nZabaden said the beneficiaries were selected after intensive screening, noting that the orphans are of between the ages of seven and nine years, and that they would enjoy the scholarship from primary school to secondary school. \nHe said after their graduation, the orphanage would enroll them into a skills acquisition training program to enable them to become self-reliant. \nThere are about 49,000 unaccompanied children in various camps in the Northeast Nigeria as a result of the Boko Haram crisis, according to crisis management reports. \nThe Boko Haram insurgency, which began in 2009, has left nearly 20,000 people dead and millions displaced.

      "text": "Ceasefire violations extends Yemen’s peace process Ceasefire violations deepen uncertainty of peace process in Yemen Oct 21, 2016 \nYemen’s dominant Shiite Houthi group traded accusations with Saudi Arabia on Friday over breaching a ceasefire mediated by the United Nations, deepening the uncertainty of the peace process in the country. \nThe UN-brokered 72-hour ceasefire, meant to last for three days, came into effect on Wednesday midnight. \nAccording to a statement released by Houthi-run media, a Thursday night air strike by the Saudi-led coalition killed three civilians in the northern province of Saada. \nThe coalition accused the Houthis of firing rockets on the southern Saudi cities of Jazan and Najran, killing two civilians, according to a statement by Saudi official media. \nMeanwhile, Saudi-backed Yemeni government of exiled President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi said its troops in the Yemeni central province of Marib shot down three missiles fired by Houthis late on Thursday. \nThe ceasefire is aimed at facilitating humanitarian aid supplies to the war-stricken cities. \nUN officials hoped the truce would be extended to pave the way for resuming stalled peace talks and to end the war. \nPrevious attempts to cease fire between warring parties in Yemen had hardly been observed, with all sides involved in the conflict trading accusations of violating the truce. \nCeasefires backed by the UN are frequently interrupted. \nOn March. 23, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, special envoy of the UN secretary-general for Yemen, announced that a nationwide ceasefire in Yemen was scheduled to begin in April, and peace talks scheduled to begin in Kuwait. \nHowever, the Houthis accused Saudi-led coalition warplanes of killing seven Houthi followers in the Houthi-held capital Sanaa on May 8, which triggered the Houthi and Saleh delegations to walk out of the talks in protest. \nA day later, the warring parties came back to the peace table in Kuwait and in June the UN special envoy said that “after extensive discussions with the participants, the main principles that will guide the next phase of Yemeni talks had been established.” \nTalks continued while Houthi group and the Saudi-led coalition accused each other of violating the ceasefires. \nOn Oct. 17, the UN declared that a 72-hour ceasefire between Houthi fighters and their rival Saudi-backed exiled government forces will take effect at 2359 local time (2059 GMT) on Oct. 19. \nHowever, the ceasefire became fragile after the warring sides traded accusations of breaching it. \nThe conflict in Yemen began after Arab-spring style 2011 mass protests that eventually forced former President Ali Abdullah Saleh out of power. \nThe Houthis, supported by Saleh, seized the Yemeni capital Sana’a and some other Yemeni cities in September 2014, forcing President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and his government into exile. \nThe Houthis and their ally forces loyal to Saleh have controlled most of Yemen’s northern regions since September 2014, while the Saudi-backed Hadi’s government has worked with its tribal allies in the southern provinces they recaptured from Houthi rebels. \nThe Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen’s conflict in March 2015 with an air force campaign to restore Hadi to the power and roll back Houthi gains. \nThe 19-month civil war has killed over 10,000 people, mostly civilians.

      "text": "Inside Africa South African cabinet approves publishing of hate crime bill The cabinet of South Africa has approved that a bill on hate crime and hate speech be published for soliciting public comments, Minister in the Presidency for Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Jeff Radebe said Thursday. Oct 21, 2016 tweet \nThe Prevention and Combating of Hate Crimes and Hate Speech Bill seeks to create the offences of hate crimes and hate speech and to put in place measures to prevent and combat these offences, Radebe said at a press briefing in Pretoria after a cabinet meeting. \nThe aim is to address the increasing number of racial incidents and to further address other types of criminal conducts motivated by bias, prejudice or intolerance, in the form of hate crimes and hate speech, the minister said. \nThis is in line with the National Development Plan which highlights the need for sustained campaigns against racism, sexism, homophobia and xenophobia, he added. \nThis came as the country had seen an increase in the manifestation of hate speech and hate crimes. \nEarlier this year, Penny Sparrow, a former estate agent, made headlines when she vented her displeasure at the number of black people swarming public beaches in Durban during the New Year holiday, likening them to “monkeys.” Her comments went viral on social media and caused a public uproar. \nAccording to the bill, a hate crime is committed if a person commits a common law or statutory offence (referred to as the “base crime or offence”) while being motivated by unlawful bias, prejudice or intolerance.

Communications director of the NPP, Nana Akomea said the party has moved past the debate. \n“When IEA offered their platform for us to debate the NDC and Mahama rejected it, so one month to elections what does the President think that now he wants a debate all of a sudden, we have moved past the debate because he withdrew from the debate… what is he going to tell us at the debate that he can’t tell us anywhere,” Akomea said. \nSource: Ghana/StarrFMonline.com/103.5FM  ",

      "text": "Kalyppo Comment: Mahama is collapsing Ghanaian businesses Oct 21, 2016 tweet \nThe 2016 presidential candidate of the New Patriotic Party, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, has described as reckless, the comments made by Chief of Staff of the Mahama administration, Julius Debrah, who, whilst campaigning in the Brong Ahafo region, urged Ghanaians to stop patronizing made-in-Ghana fruit juice beverage, Kalyppo. \nAccording to Nana Akufo-Addo, after killing Ghanaian businesses in the last eight years because of poor policies, the Mahama government is now actively campaigning to collapse Ghanaian businesses, which employ thousands of people across the country. \n“I have heard one of Mahama’s appointees (Chief of Staff, Julius Debrah) saying that Ghanaians should no longer consume Kalyppo because it contains sugar. So after killing Ghanaian businesses, they are now campaigning to make sure that no one patronises made-in-Ghana products, and thereby collapse Ghanaian businesses? Ghanaians should not pay heed to such loose-talk from officials of the Mahama government,” he said. \nNana Akufo-Addo continued, “If, indeed, sugar was bad, why have they set up the Komenda sugar factory, a factory they have made so much noise about? To them, sugar is bad and, yet, they spent so much money on the Komenda sugar factory, which is not even working? This propaganda will not work.” \nThe NPP flagbearer stressed that “this year, whatever it is they say, whatever propaganda they churn out, will not work. Ghanaians are going to vote and bring into office an Akufo-Addo government, which is going to improve the wellbeing of Ghanaians. The wind of change is blowing all across Ghana, and nothing, nothing, is going to stop it from succeeding.” \nNana Akufo-Addo was addressing a mammoth night rally at Kwadaso, on Thursday, October 20, 2016, at the end of day-2 of his 4-day campaign tour of the Ashanti region, when he made this known. \nThe NPP flagbearer maintained that Ghanaians have one simple task ahead of them in this year’s elections. \n“The task is to use our thumbs to unseat Mahama and bring in a government led by Akufo-Addo. I am here to appeal to residents of Kwadaso, Kumasi and Asanteman to throw their support behind me, like never before. I want you to vote massively for me, so we can go into Jubilee House and do a job for all Ghanaians which will create jobs, wealth and prosperity for all Ghanaians,” he added. \nNana Akufo-Addo assured the thousands and thousands gathered that he, together with the NPP, is seeking the mandate of the Ghanaian people, so as to be able to use it to implement the policies and programmes which will return Ghana onto the path of progress and prosperity. \n“These policies include the revival of the National Health Insurance Scheme, the effective implementation of the Free SHS policy, the 1-District-1-Factory policy, the establishment of the Infrastructure for Poverty Eradication Programme (IPEP), which will ensure that every constituency will receive the equivalent of $1million dollars every year to address developmental issues in the 275 constituencies, amongst others. I will implement all of these policies to the letter,” he assured. \nThe NPP flagbearer, in concluding, urged residents of Kwadaso to rally behind the NPP’s parliamentary candidate for the constituency, Dr. Samiu Nuamah, and vote massively for him, so the party can eclipse the 83.82% margin of victory obtained in the 2012 elections.Nana Akufo-Addo also campaigned in the Manhyia South, Atwima Nwabiagya and Adansi Asokwa constituencies on Thursday. \nSource: Ghana/starrfmonline.com/103.5FM/Kojo Addae/Freelancer  ",

      "title": "US election: Obama Renders Trump’s Election Rhetoric As Dangerous",
      "text": "US election: Obama Renders Trump’s Election Rhetoric As Dangerous Oct 21, 2016 tweet \nPresident Barack Obama has said Republican Donald Trump’s insistence that he might not accept the election result is “dangerous”. \nSpeaking at a campaign rally in Miami for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, the president said Mr Trump’s comments undermined American democracy. \nMr Trump refused in a televised debate to say he would accept the outcome of the election on 8 November.He later said he would accept a “clear” result but left a challenge open. \nSpeaking in Ohio on Thursday, Mr Trump said, with a grin: “I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States, that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election – if I win.” \nIn the same speech, he said he would accept a clear election result but reserved the right to file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable one. \nHours later, the president said that sowing the seeds of doubt in people’s minds about the legitimacy of US elections provided a boost to the country’s enemies. \n“You’re doing the work of our adversaries for them, because our democracy depends on people knowing that their vote matters,” said Mr Obama. \nMr Trump has been heavily criticised by many in his own party by suggesting he might not accept the election result. \nFor days, he has claimed the election is rigged against him, due to media bias and voter fraud.During Wednesday night’s debate with Mrs Clinton, when moderator Chris Wallace asked Mr Trump if he would accept losing to her, the Republican nominee said he would “keep you in suspense”. \nMr Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, later insisted that the candidate had meant he would not concede until the “results are actually known”. \nRepublican Senator John McCain, who lost to Mr Obama eight years ago, said: “A concession isn’t just an exercise in graciousness. It is an act of respect for the will of the American people, a respect that is every American leader’s first responsibility.” \nFirst Lady Michelle Obama also joined the attack on Thursday, saying “you do not keep American democracy in suspense”. \nSource: BBC  ",

      "text": "‘Mad Man’ & ‘Illiterate MP’ cross swords On \n\nFrom Alfred Adams, Takoradi. The Member of Parliament (MP) for Ekumfi Constituency in the Central Region, Mr. Abeiku Crentsil, yesterday caused a stir on a live radio show in Takoradi, when he went bonkers, refusing to debate Ebenezer Spio, Spokesperson for Essilfie Buckman, who has resigned as Constituency Chairman of the ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC) in the Ekumfi Constituency. \nInstead of responding to the circumstances leading to his Chairman’s resignation and subsequent defection to the New Patriotic Party (NPP), which was why the MP was called into the show, Abeiku Crentsil rather decided to employ a smart game, by attacking the intelligence of the Spokesperson. \nPushed by the host of the show, Kwame Malcolm, to respond to the allegation surrounding the role the MP himself had allegedly played, leading to the resignation of the Constituency Chairman, MP Crentsil shockingly told the host that he would not debate a ‘mad man’ (referring to the Spokesperson). \nThis was when the MP was asked by the host of the show to hold the line for the Spokesperson to react to the MP’s earlier statement. \nBut, before the Spokesperson could do that, the MP shockingly told the host he would not speak to a ‘mad man’ on radio. “What do you mean Sir?” asked the host of the show. \nCrentsil then proceeded to explain what he meant by referring to the gentleman who called himself the Spokesperson as a ‘mad man’. \nAccording to the MP, Ebenezer Spio was a known ‘mad man’ in the constituency. As a result, “Can’t I speak to a mad man,” MP Crentsil was heard saying loudly on radio. \nFor this reason, he requested the host of the show to end the interview since there was no way he could speak and debate a known ‘mad man’. \n“Do you have his medical record to suggest that he is a mad man?” asked Kwame Malcolm Interestingly, the MP, who responded in the opposite, rather went on the defensive, arguing that it was a known fact in the Ekumfi traditional area that Ebenezer Spio is a mad man, and then dropped the line. \nResponding, Ebenezer Spio decried the description by the MP. To Spio, he was not perturbed by the MP’s description of him, and that he would prefer to be referred to as mad man, than have an MP who could not construct a simple sentence in English. \nIt would be recalled that the Ekumfi Constituency Chairman of the ruling party, Essilfie Buckman, resigned on Monday from the party, accusing the MP and executives of dirty deals. \nThe resignation of the Chairman comes exactly three weeks after the NDC Constituency Organiser in Shama, in the Western Region, also resigned from the party over alleged dirty contract deals. \nAccording to Mr. Buckman, his decision was based on a raw deal meted out to him by the NDC during last year’s parliamentary primaries. \nHe explained at a press conference on Monday that prior to the November 21 primary, executives of the party schemed to disqualify the two main challengers to the incumbent MP, Abeiku Crentsil. His opposition to the move saw his name mysteriously expunged from the register. He said as a result, he could not vote. Mr Buckman claims that a meeting to resolve the wrangling in the party was convened in Accra, and subsequently ended with an agreement on GH¢1,000 for “reconciliatory refreshment.””I regret, however, to state that as I speak to you, this has never happened, and I do not know when it would be done,” he told journalists. “I want to ask where the money is; Na sika no wo hen ?” Mr. Buckman, who arrived at the venue for the press conference in a political suit, quickly grabbed a T-shirt of the NPP parliamentary candidate, Ato Cudjoe, and wore it. He said there had also been several decisions taken behind his back. \nFor instance, the Constituency Chairman claims a Toyota Mahindra vehicle meant for him was given to the Constituency Treasurer without his knowledge. \n",

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) US President Barack Obama stands with First Lady Michelle Obama shortly before greeting Indian President Manmohan Singh and his wife Gursharan Kaur at the North Portico of the White House November 24, 2009, as the Obamas host thier first official State Dinner. AFP Photo/Nicholas Kamm (Photo credit should read NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images) \nIn her time as First Lady, Michelle Obama has shown an unparalleled sense of poise, navigating her responsibilities with the utmost style and grace. \nAnd on the eve of her final state dinner, Mrs. Obama joined her husband, President Obama, on the White House lawn in one of her signature Gi \nambattista Valli fit-and-flare A-line dresses. \nThough the palette of white, black and gray was quite different from the colorful look she has worn in the past, the dress’s chevron pattern and knife-pleated skirt was no less eye-catching. The embellished neckline added a subtly glamorous finish, too, while the thin black belt was a figure-flattering touch. \nOf course, the question on everyone’s minds right now is what the First Lady will wear to tonight’s state dinner—will she choose Gucci again, given that the dinner is in honor of the Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s official visit ? \nCould this be another moment for Christian Siriano ? Will she call on Jason Wu , a designer she’s worn on so many occasions? Whichever way she ends up going this evening, her latest look bodes well for what’s in store. \nMichelle Obama Takes A Bow \nAs Michelle Obama tucks into velvety pasta pillows and beef tenderloin with her husband Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and various high-profile guests at Tuesday night’s state dinner, here’s a look back at some of her most memorable state dinner fashion . \nThe first lady has hosted 14 state dinners in total, including India in 2009, Mexico in 2010, Korea in 2011 and the Nordic countries in May this year. \nHer most notable FLOTUS fashion statements include the amazing Vera Wang mermaid dress she wore for China’s state dinner in 2015 and the ivory column gown designed by Lady Gaga’s former stylist Brandon Maxwell that she debuted for dinner with Singapore’s Prime Minister earlier this summer. Public Image and Style \nWith the ascent of her husband as a prominent national politician, Obama has become a part of popular culture. In May 2006, Essence listed her among “25 of the World’s Most Inspiring Women.” \nIn July 2007, Vanity Fair listed her among “10 of the World’s Best Dressed People.” She was an honorary guest at Oprah Winfrey’s Legends Ball as a “young’un” paying tribute to the ‘Legends,’ who helped pave the way for African American women. \nIn September 2007, 02138 magazine listed her 58th of ‘The Harvard 100’; a list of the prior year’s most influential Harvard alumni . Her husband was ranked fourth. In July 2008, she made a repeat appearance on the Vanity Fair international best dressed list. \nShe also appeared on the 2008 People list of best-dressed women and was praised by the magazine for her “classic and confident” look. \nObama has been compared to Jacqueline Kennedy due to her sense of style. \n",

      "text": "Politics Ghana urged to raise women representation in politics Gender and political activists on Thursday called on political parties to give space to women to participate in the electoral process in Ghana. Oct 21, 2016 tweet \nEkutu Aukot, a former chair of Selection Panel, Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission of Kenya, said Africans must create a contest that will allow women to participate in political office up to the highest office in the land. \n“Political contest is a male-dominated game so much so that when a woman wants to participate in politics, she meets disrespect. So the contest in which we operate is one thing that we must actually confront going forward,” he said. \nHe was speaking at a policy dialogue on gender equal participation and leadership in politics and electoral process in Ghana, organized by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and its partners. \nThe dialogue aims to deconstruct the role of political parties in promoting gender equal political participation and the role political parties can play in supporting women inclusion and participation in political processes at all levels. \nIt offered an opportunity to political parties, practitioners and advocates to interact and begin a process of building common group on improving gender balance in Ghana politics. \nRecent political statistics show that Ghana currently ranks 150 out of 187 in the inter-parliamentary Union on women representation in parliament. \nIn Ghana, only 29 legislatures out of the current 275 are women, a situation seen as a clear contradiction when one compares Ghana’s democratic standing with the rest of Africa. \nThe Country Director of UNDP Dominic Sam called on Ghana to work towards ensuring that women are well represented in the political circles as leaders and decision-makers. \nHe was optimistic that through the debate, participants will examine and gain a better understanding of the issues — the challenge faced by women in their efforts to access political opportunities in Ghana.

Oct 21, 2016 tweet \nThere are more than 140 UN staff in Chad who came to the clinic run by the institution \nThe representative of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Chad, Jean-Marie Viany Yameogo, lamented the lack of culture to donate blood voluntarily by Africans. He urged to advocate mobilization campaigns to make people understand the meaning of blood donation. \n“In Africa, the demand for blood transfusion and blood product is very strong and domestic medical agencies are faced with finding enough blood,” said Yameogo. \nHospitals of Chad lack enough blood. Yameogo said the demand of the precious liquid is much higher than supply and blood centers must meet the double challenges of providing hospitals with sufficient blood while ensuring its quality and safety. \nChadina National Blood Transfusion Center was created in 1972. Today, the rate of voluntary donation is only 14 percent for N’Djamena, and 5 percent for the whole country.  ",

Oct 21, 2016 tweet \nPrime Minister Kassim Majaliwa said those behind the demise of the once giant state-run industries will be squarely dealt by the government. \nHe cited the defunct state-run industries as Sungura, Kilitex, Mutex and the Southern Paper Mills, saying their collapse was masterminded by irresponsible and corrupt officials. \n“The country made fortunes from those factories but thanks to their dishonesty and corrupt minded schemes, such industries no longer exist. We will not allow that to happen in this era and those responsible will suffer the consequences,” the PM said in the northern Tanzanian city of Arusha when speaking at the sixth National Social Security Fund (NSSF) stakeholders’ meeting. \nHis remarks came at the time when the east African nation had conceived the industrialization plan as the main catalyst to transform the economy, generate sustainable growth and reduce poverty.

      "text": "AMA exceeds revenue target from Gh¢10m to Gh¢40m Okoe Vanderpuije Raises AMA Revenue from Gh¢10m to Gh¢40m Oct 21, 2016 tweet \nThe Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA) has tripped its revenue from Gh¢10 million to Gh¢40 million under the able leadership of the indefatigable Mayor of Accra, Dr. Alfred Okoe Vanderpuije. \nThis unmatched feat was achieved after the Mayor, Dr. Alfred Okoe Vanderpuije tok over the management of the Assembly from 2009; implementing feasible steps in ensuring that more revue is generated by the Assembly to enable it implement more developmental projects within the region. \nIt is an undeniable fact that the Mayor of Accra, who has achieved so much for the people of Ghana, placing Accra on a pedestal among cities of the world, has become a household name both home and abroad. \nIn 2015, the Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA), exceeded its revenue target by four million Ghana Cedis, in 2014. \nIn that year, the Assembly budgeted for 26 million Ghana Cedis and made 30 million Ghana Cedis through an intensive revenue mobilization drive implemented by the Mayor, to generate more funds to expand the scope of its development projects. \nDr Alfred Oko Vanderpuije, the Accra Metropolitan Chief Executive, who is also the NDC Parliamentary candidate for Ablekuma South Constituency disclosed during his house-to-house campaign that in 2015, The Assembly had targeted 86 million Ghana Cedis for the Assembly to realize its vision of transforming the city and building more schools in the metropolis. \nResidents of Ablekuma South were thrown into wild jubilation when Dr. Alfred Okoe Vanderpuije broke the news of helping the Assembly to triple its revenue from Gh¢10 million to Gh¢40 million in 2016. \nHe said, under his leadership the Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA) embarked on a rigorous revenue mobilisation drive with the projection to increase its revenue by 17.3 per cent in 2016. Dr Alfred Okoe Vanderpuije, said the achievement was as result of that vigorous revenue mobilisation campaigns the assembly had embarked upon since 2009 which had seen a revenue increase of more than 100 per cent. \nHe told supporters that the AMA’s internally generated fund (IGF) in 2011 increased by GH¢20,323,193, representing 53.1 per cent, while in 2012, it increased by GH¢22,990,853.81, which represented 13.1 per cent. \nWith respect to 2013, he indicated that revenue increased by GH¢25,100,000, representing 9.1 per cent, and in 2015 it recorded a GH¢32.145749.12 rise that represented 28 per cent. His revelation was greeted by loud applause and cheers from members of the constituency who were happy to hear that chunk of the revenue collected was ploughed into areas such as education, infrastructure, health, sanitation, agriculture, transportation, roads and the street-naming exercise. \nDr Alfred Okoe Vanderpuije also told his people that the assembly had, beginning from February this year, pursued the prosecution of people who defaulted in their tax obligations in 2015, resulting in the great achievement and the unprecedented increase in revenue, first in the history of the AMA. \nHe also indicated that, the claims by the opposition NPP that the NDC has done nothing for the communities cannot be accepted since, the AMA under his watch abolished the shift system in the 2010/2011 academic year, and had successfully completed and furnished 14 Millennium City Schools (MCSs) out of the 100 that were under construction as part of efforts to improve the quality of education in the country. \nThe assembly, he stated, would inaugurate newly completed Millennium City Schools and also work on the construction of six new schools under the Urban Development Grant. He also pointed out that his tireless efforts to build a better city has placed Accra among thirty-five (35) Most Resilient Cities in the world, of which the Rockefeller Foundation awarded Accra $1,000,000 fund to assists the city to develop. \nDr. Alfred Okoe Vanderpuije, this was not achieved overnight but through “leadership role and tireless efforts” he played in ensuring that Accra becomes a resilient one through innovations such as the Millennium City School project. \nHe however disabused the minds of the people from the claims by the NPP and his opponent that the Rockefeller Foundation fund had been squandered on his campaign. According to him, Foundations like Rockefeller will not give out money to people who will have nothing better to do than to squander and that, the continuous project he is undertaking within the city has also won the admiration of Bloomberg Foundation. \n“This is great for us and for our nation,” he said. \nHe promised that the City of Accra will continue to grow under his care even more as the MP for Ablekuma South. He appealed to the people to vote massively for him as the MP and for the NDC as the governing party in the coming election on December 7. \nBy Prosper Agbenyega Do you have more to share about this story - photos or video etc - you can send them to: (newsghana101@gmail.com) TAGS",

And I can assure you that we are ready and the President will show up if EIB holds the debate…we will wait for you to present the proposal then we move it forward,” Adams told Arday Clegg. \nPresident Mahama who had turned down an IEA proposal for a debate between him and the opposition leader has over the past few weeks been pushing for a one-on-one challenge with the three-time flagbearer. \nHe told the Volta Star in an interview Thursday that such a debate will him and Nana Addo to justify the claims they are both making on the performance of the economy. \nBut the NPP has described the President’s call as hypocritical. They argue the President should have taken up the IEA debate request if he was interested in debating their candidate. \nSpokesperson for the NPP presidential candidate Mustapha Hammid told Arday Clegg that they are not ready to debate the president now since their focus is on the campaign. \nSource: Ghana/StarrFMonline.com/103.5FM/Kwame Danso Acheampong Do you have more to share about this story - photos or video etc - you can send them to: (newsghana101@gmail.com) TAGS",

      "text": "News CADDP improving food and nutrition security-report says The Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) is having positive effects toward greater food and nutrition security in countries that have implemented the process Oct 21, 2016 tweet \nThe Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) is having a positive impact on food and nutrition security in countries that are implementing it, according to the just released 2015 Annual Trends and Outlook Report (ATOR). \nThe ATOR, was released yesterday by the Regional Strategic Analysis and Knowledge Support System (ReSAKSS), a program facilitated by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), during the opening of the 2016 ReSAKSS Annual Conference in Accra, organized by IFPRI in partnership with the African Union Commission. \nThe 2015 ATOR examines the current status of nutrition in Africa, including progress in meeting the 2014 AU Malabo nutrition targets, and highlights the importance of dietary quality and diversity. It further stresses the importance of strengthening capacities for nutrition mainstreaming, monitoring and evaluation. \nIt stated that, “Undernourishment is lowest among countries that have not yet adopted the CAADP process,” and that, “The rates of reduction in undernourishment are faster in CAADP countries especially those that have been in the process the longest and those that have gone through most of the stages of the process.” \nOfficially opening the 2016 ReSAKSS annual conference, AUC Commissioner for Rural Economy and Agriculture, H.E Tumusiime Rhoda Peace, represented by Dr. Janet Edeme, Acting Director for the Department of Rural Economy and Agriculture (DREA), said achieving a nutrition revolution would require informed plans and investments coupled with leadership for effective implementation. \n“The complexity and multi-sectorality of nutrition demand for better coordination of interventions in order to make real and effective impact. By investing in a nutrition revolution, we are reducing malnutrition at all levels of the population including children and women, as spelt out in Africa’s Agenda 2063,” she said. \nBy investing in a nutrition revolution, we are reducing malnutrition at all levels of the population including children and women \n“Improving food security is not only about making sure people are consuming adequate calories, but ensuring that diets provide adequate nutrients for the healthy growth and development of Africa’s children and the health and wellbeing of all people,” said Ousmane Badiane, IFPRI Director for Africa. “This report shows that policymakers must not only monitor nutrition outcomes but set ambitious targets and design appropriate strategies to achieve these. The first step to reducing poverty and promoting economic growth in Africa is to reduce hunger and malnutrition which rob the continent of its human resource potential.” \nAccording to IFPRI, more key findings of the report include: \nStatistics and trends indicate a need for more concerted effort in tackling a triple burden of malnutrition in Africa that includes reducing under-nutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, and overweight and obesity. \nThe potential nutritional impact of existing food policies (including agricultural subsidies) should be reviewed, and reforms should be initiated for those policies that are likely to have adverse effects on people’s dietary quality and body weight. \nComprehensive monitoring and evaluation systems, complete with key nutrition indicators and contextualized evidence, are needed to evaluate the impact of comprehensive investment plans on nutrition and attainment of the international, continental, and national commitments for growth, development, and nutrition. \nOverall, the analysis of CAADP indicators shows that countries that have been in the CAADP process the longest and those that have gone through most of the levels of the CAADP process have tended to register better outcomes in most of the indicators reviewed, thus highlighting the positive impact of CAADP. \nIt is essential to harness the potential for science, technology, and innovation to reduce postharvest losses and food waste; promote product diversification with nutritious foods; improve processing to extend shelf life and make healthy foods easier to prepare; and improve storage and preservation to retain nutritional value, ensure food safety, and extend seasonal availability. \nSource: NewsGhana.com.gh  ",

But, it was not, he added. \nHe noted the contentious disqualification will not stop “Dr. Hassan Ayariga bid to become president of Ghana. He was only 44 years old,” he said, adding he has so many years to go until 72. \nThe EC has disqualified 12 presidential aspirants including Mr. Ayariga over nomination form anomalies. \nThe EC explained that it was unable to accept Mr Ayariga’s nomination because he did not “provide evidence on his statutory declaration as to his hometown or residence in the constituency as per the legal requirements,” an explanation Mr. Ayariga labeled as “big lie.” \nAccording to him, his disqualification is part of a grand plot to thwart his bid to become the country’s president. \nSource: Ghana|StarrFMonline.com|103.5FM|Mohammed Awal  ",

      "text": "Common pitfalls when valuing property Oct 21, 2016 tweet \nFor some firms, being awarded an instruction to value a property or portfolio of real estate assets is often not given sufficient regard, says TC Chetty, country manager for South Africa for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). \n“While new business is always welcome, new business is not necessarily ‘good’ business if insufficient attention is paid to actual qualification and competence, and this puts any valuer in a potentially risky situation. \n“When cash flow is tight, there may be pressure to accept any valuation instruction, which may lead to firms accepting instructions where they are unable to demonstrate detailed sector knowledge or where they don’t have the correct specialist skills.” \nIn South Africa, all practicing valuers must be registered with the South African Council for the Property Valuers Profession. \nGraham Stockey, principal assurance surveyor, Regulation for RICS, explains further: “This includes a range of scenarios such as practitioners from a non-valuation discipline carrying out valuation instructions without the necessary training or experience, a valuer accepting instructions in a country or location where they do not possess the required detailed knowledge of the local market, or where a valuer who only has experience of valuing residential property is asked to provide a valuation report on a huge property portfolio which spans many locations and includes hotels and commercial and industrial property. \n“If you were a client in the latter instance, you would not be happy to know that your valuer didn’t have much experience on mixed use and commercial property.” \nStockey says when undertaking a valuation the Terms of Engagement document between client and valuer is the most important in a case file. This document details the responsibilities and the scope of work required. \n“Practitioners can often leave out essential basics which we categorise as ‘who am I’? This includes qualifications, competence and status. Who is my client and other intended users, and why do they want the valuation? After that, really poor terms of reference may fail to include the four key pillars, namely address/ type of property/ user/interest to be valued, the valuation date, basis of value and special assumptions. \n“When large sums of money are involved, it is critically important that valuers set out limitations of their due diligence. This is particularly important for the purposes of professional indemnity insurance and relates to limitations to inspections and investigations, assumptions and the source of all information and reliability.” \nHe says a good Terms of Engagement document should also include general declarations about publication and sharing, third party reliability, compliance with International Valuation Standards (IVS) or ‘Red Book’ and any other regulation or legislation. It should also include a complaints handling procedure statement confirming that the valuation report has been produced in accordance with IVS and RICS Valuation Professional Standards, and the fee or how the fee will be calculated.” \nAvoid conflict of interest \nStockey also points out that a conflict of interest may arise and is anything that impedes or might be perceived to impede an individual’s or firm’s ability to act impartially and in the best interest of a client. A conflict of interest can cast doubt on a valuer’s integrity and can also have a damaging effect on his or her firm and the profession as a whole. \n“RICS requires valuers to act independently and objectively and without conflicts of interest. \n“Valuers must make a file note of all checks carried out into previous involvement with any aspect of the valuation instruction, including all parties to the property transaction, the property itself and any cross-discipline connection they may have with parties involved in the transaction.” \nHe says acting when a clear conflict of interest exists – and not declaring it to clients is unacceptable for a valuer and does not comply with RICS Rules of Conduct or Red Book requirements. Where a conflict, or potential conflict is identified, not giving due consideration as to whether the instruction should be accepted or declined is also not acceptable. \n“Results of any conflict of interest check should always be recorded as this is the valuer’s only way to demonstrate having confirmed his or her independence prior to commencing with the task. Failure to clearly define and record steps taken to manage a potential conflict in the case file, Terms of Engagement and the report is where valuers can fall down. \n“Equally, if not more important for a valuer is to maintain a record of any discussions, e-mails, or letters relating to the management of any potential conflict of interest. Otherwise, how can you later prove you informed your client if that person chooses to challenge you?” concludes Stockey. \nFor further information contact TC Chetty, RICS Country Manager for South Africa on 031 7644645 or 083 264 3134 or email tcchetty@rics.org. \nIssued by Gaye de Villiers  ",

      "title": "Letting Kogi State Governor work in peace-Odemegwu writes",
      "text": "Letting Kogi State Governor work in peace-Odemegwu writes Kogi Politicians Should Let Gov. Bello Be Oct 21, 2016 tweet \nThe Executive Governor of Kogi State, Alhaji Yahaya Bello may be in for another set of distraction after the Supreme Court on September 20 2016 upheld his election as the rightful winner of the gubernatorial election in the state held in 2015. It is perceived that some politicians in the state are working round the clock in making sure that the governor suffers a setback in his administration. \nRecently, they accused the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) of keeping eyes right in their call to investigate Bello for whatever reason Nigerians are yet to know. This was coming after they had written series of petition to the body. But the EFCC seemed to know better – that there might be the hand of Jacob but the voice of Esau in their petition – making their petition null and void. \nThe other time, there were speculations that he was pelted with pure water sachet while coming out from the Mosque, after a day’s prayer. If true that he was pelted, political observers know who to hold responsible. And if he was not pelted, the same people know who to hold responsible for circulating the message of defame. \nMost politicians hire crowd for an event, the same way they hire street urchins to cast aspersion before the public, on the personality of their prey. However, Nigerians of good will cannot sit down and watch Alhaji Yahaya Bello, the young and youthful Governor of Kogi State be brought to disrepute. We are yet to read that he associates with mischief, except as some politicians in that state want us to believe. \nUnlike some persons who allow some heights they have attained in life to influence and control them, the last time we checked, Bello still respects elders and is ever ready to learn from people. While he is doing his best to bring any person or group that has been politically squabbling to make peace with each other, some of the politicians are throwing tantrums. Sad! \nNo matter what they might be doing to plunge Bello into the murky waters of disgrace, the governor seems not perturbed as he goes about his official duties to uplift Kogi State, putting much effort on rural and urban development. He believes that after developing this area, it will attract a lot of potentials. \nWith his New Direction Blueprint, the governor has vowed to take education to the next level in the state. Any doubting Thomas may ask the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Petra Onyegbule. With the state’s rich mineral and natural resources, although many are yet to be tapped, Bello has said he has the youths at heart in his development priorities. \nWhile working to raise these youths, the governor has reiterated the need for technical education while people are pursuing the secular education. Nonetheless, many Nigerians might be crying over the lame-duck governance of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at the federal level, but Bello has shown that he has a New Direction Blueprint: A promise he made when he went to pick Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms of the APC in company of chieftains of the party from the three senatorial zones in the state. \nGovernor Bello pledged to overturn the high level of crimes in the state. The party leaders conversely knew that he would not disappoint in carrying out his official functions when they stopped the thought of any other candidate as the party’s typical bearer. The unwavering Bello filled out the form, signed by a Commissioner of Oath, and returned to the APC National Secretariat, in what political pundits said was affixed to a letter of nomination sent to INEC on Friday November 27 2015, by the National Chairman of APC, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun. \nThe party perhaps knew that Mr. James Abiodun Faleke might not do better than Bello, hence Falake was asked to be Bello’s running mate. But Faleke refused that offer and insisted on Abubakar Audu/Faleke ticket, which the party gave the duo before Audu suddenly died on November 22, 2015. It will be pertinent to say that with the aggressive policking against Bello in Kogi, if the state fails, it will concern everybody in the state. But it will not fail with Bello! \nSo, Governor Yahaya Bello should be left without distractions to earnestly fix the state to attain his dream state, where there will no longer be pot holes in front of the Government House, educational system will never be horrible again, Kogi children will not be taught under the trees, teachers will not be discouraged; the potentialities of the agriculture sector will not be undiscovered, and infrastructure will not be in totters.

It’s a completely different animal,” she says. “It’s a lighter feeling.” Do you have more to share about this story - photos or video etc - you can send them to: (newsghana101@gmail.com) TAGS",

      "text": "CEOs Urged To Have Digital Strategies Every Business Needs A Digital Strategy-MTN CEO Oct 21, 2016 tweet \nEbenezer Twum Asante, the CEO of MTN has urged all businesses to search and tap into the digital opportunities that abound, irrespective of one’s industry. He said, looking at the way businesses are rapidly shifting from the physical interaction to a more digital space, businesses without digital strategies would have a hard time connecting with consumers. \nMr. Asante was engaging members of the Chartered Institute of Marketing Ghana (CIMG), as part of CIMG’s annual strategy to enable members engage industry leaders. He spoke on the theme Digital Lifestyle & Mobile Financial Services: Inclusiveness, Trends & Opportunities. He said, “You do not need to be a digital business to have a digital strategy”. “So long as your customers are going more and more digital, it is not only about communication, advertising or product visibility in the digital environment, but it is also about how you re-model your own business to take advantage of this trend.” \nThe Africa consumer is more mobile ready now than ever and consumers are leapfrogging landline infrastructure and jumping straight into digital mobile technology. This fast growth in internet penetration is in tandem with the growing spate of Mobile Money subscription. Thus the best way to monetise digital business innovations is through Mobile Financial Services. \n“The debit and credit card penetration in Ghana is very marginal,” he said. “So if you manage to pull up a wonderful digital strategy, the best way to monetise it is mainly through Mobile Financial Service.” \nFollowing the introduction of the MTN Mobile Money Service in Ghana in 2009, the subscriber base has grown to approximately 7.8 million registered customers, with over 48,000 Mobile Money agents performing over 40 million transactions monthly across the country. \nAlso, in line with the EMI Guidelines issued by the Bank of Ghana in July 2015, MTN made a total payment of GH₵ 13.4million in interest to over 6.2 million Mobile Money customers in September. MTN Mobile Money continues to partner financial institutions and other values to deliver the best value propositions to customers. One of such is the TBILL4ALL service launched recently in partnership with Ecobank. \n ",

      "text": "Doctor reveals prostate cancer death has increased in Nigeria 26 men die daily of Prostate Cancer in Nigeria… Men’s Health Charity to intervene—Prof. Obu Oct 21, 2016 tweet \nFounder and President of Men’s Health Foundation (MHF)- Ghana & Nigeria, Professor Dr. Raphael Nyarkotey Obu, has revealed that twenty six (26) Nigerian men die daily of prostate cancer. \nAccording to him, the rate at which men diagnosed with prostate cancer die in Nigeria was very alarming. \nProf. Nyarkotey Obu, who is a prostate cancer researcher and a policy maker, made the revelation. \nHe said what was even more worrying about the Nigeria problem was the fact that awareness level of the disease (prostate cancer) was very low. \n“In fact there is little awareness of prostate cancer in Nigeria compared to the kind of publicity my NGO-Men’s Health Foundation-has created in Ghana,” Prof. Nyarkotey Obu disclosed. \nThe low awareness of prostate cancer in Nigeria, Prof. Nyarkotey Obu, disclosed has compelled his non-governmental organisation (MHF) to spread it wings into Nigeria and help prevent more prostate cancer deaths. \n“…In fact the rate at which men diagnosed with prostate cancer die in Nigeria is very alarming, and that is why MHF has formed the Nigerian branch. And through our Nigerian branch we aim to create awareness on the disease in all the States of Nigeria and also help prevent prostate cancer deaths in Nigeria,” Prof. Nyarkotey Obu emphasised. \nThe prostate cancer researcher further hinted that his NGO will also lobby the powers-that-be in Nigeria and push for Father’s Day to be recognised as National Prostate Cancer Day in Nigeria “like we are hoping to achieve in Ghana.” According to Prof. Nyarkotey Obu, the launch of the Men’s Health Foundation Nigeria will come off on November 15, 2016 in Lagos. \nThe Coordinator of MHF-Nigeria, Samuel Larbi Ariyo, who was with Prof. Nyarkotey Obu, disclosed that since his branch was making inroads after a month’s of being in operation. \n“…More prominent Nigerians including politicians, government officials have expressed interest in the project and are willing to support the NGO,” he noted. \nHe went on to reveal that the Nigerian branch of Men’s Health Foundation has an 8-member committee which is headed by Mr. Samuel Babalola. \n“For now what we are basically doing is that we are feverishly preparing towards the official launch of the Nigerian branch of Men’s Health Foundation in Lagos which is slated for November 15, 2016,” Mr. Ariyo averred. \nAccording to Dr. Raphael Nyarkotey Obu who is a research Professor of Prostate cancer & Holistic Medicine at Da Vinci College of Holistic Medicine, Cyprus further revealed that, Prostate cancer is the number one cancer killer of Nigerian men! In Nigeria, prostate cancer has a mortality rate of over eighty percent (80%)! A recent report by World Health Organization (WHO) shows that within a period of four years, deaths from prostate cancer in Nigeria increased by almost 100 per cent. The report showed that Prostate cancer now kills 26 Nigerian men every day (up from 14 men every day). \nThis increase is evident from frequent reports in the media of prominent Nigerians that have died of the disease in recent times out of ignorance. The Nigerian prostate cancer statistics is alarming and outrageous, given the fact that prostate cancer is curable if detected early. He added. \nExplaining What is responsible for the high mortality rate of prostate cancer in Nigeria and the black community, he explained that the answer is not far -fetched- lack of awareness and inadequate infrastructure and manpower for cancer prevention and treatment in Nigeria. We have relied too much on foreign research which is not beneficial because there is cancer disparity and until black scientist, Physicians, government, policy makers and researchers rise up we are unlikely to see any further headway. To improve prostate cancer survivor ship, it is important for every man to know his risk of prostate cancer as well as the signs and symptoms. \nWe will work with policy makers and other organizations to improve services delivery. We will research into the disease locally, provide support to those diagnosed, and provide training to health professionals and research into evidence based holistic medicine to address the side effect of conventional treatment. \nThere is urgent need to make prostate cancer screening widely available and accessible to all Nigerian men. He says “We cannot treat our way out of the prostate cancer problem. We need commitment to prevention and early detection is desperately needed in order to complement improved treatments and address the alarming rise in prostate cancer burden in the black community, the mortality rate is very high in Nigeria, for every six men diagnosed 5 will die leaving only one and it appears prostate cancer is a death sentence in Nigeria. He says. \nOn moving forward Dr. Nyarkotey says, “An excellent way of providing easily accessible prostate cancer screenings would be the deployment of Mobile Cancer Centres (MCC) which would take holistic health promotion to the grassroots of Nigeria and we have a plan in Nigeria as we expand our wings and services to other African countries to stop prostate cancer before it strikes as ignoring prostate cancer wont beat it. He concluded. \nBy Dr. Raphael Nyarkotey Obu  ",

      "text": "Dawn Of A New Day In Ghana It Is a Crispy New Day in Ghana Oct 21, 2016 tweet \nI knew right away, when the penis-chomping incident involving Techiman Municipal Fire Commander Eric Philip Ansah and the young woman whom the alleged victim described as his girlfriend hit the media headlines, that somebody was not tell us the truth. \nNow, as the Daily Guide tells it, it turns out that the woman who mustered the laudable courage to put Mr. Ansah on sharp notice that sexual harassment will no longer be tolerated in the Ghana Fire Service, in particular, but also Ghanaian society in general, had been persistently and consistently harassed for the four months that she had been working at the Techiman Fire Station as a janitor or cleaner. As of this writing, Ms. Ataa Takyi, whose age had not been given to the public by law-enforcement officers, was on bail while police investigators determined the merits of the case. \nCommander Ansah has also been granted a bail bond in the sum of GH₵ 2,000, while he recovers from his penile wounds and awaits the possibility of a formal indictment and trial, as well as the possibility of permanent severance from his post. So far, though, both parties have been charged with rape, in the case of Mr. Ansah, and causing deliberate harm, in the case of Mr. Takyi (See “Fire Chief Fondled My Breasts – Ataa Takyi” Ghanaweb.com 10/15/16). Indeed, Commander Ansah dug himself into a deep criminal culpability hole, when he told police investigators that he had had sexual intercourse with his collegial subordinate at least four times in the past four months. \nNow, four coituses in four months readily exposes Ms. Takyi’s workplace superior as the patent liar here; for about the only way that a supposedly loving couple would have had only four sexual encounters in four months would be in a case where one of the couples, or either one of them, had been away from the other in long intermittent spells. The other possibility would, of course, be in a situation where at least one of the couples was estranged from the other. In this case, it is readily obvious that the real victim here is Ms. Takyi who tells the Daily Guide that when she met Commander Ansah at the Techiman Fire Station, she was already in a serious and loving relationship with another man who had promised to marry her. \nCouple the preceding with the fact that it was the alleged culprit, Commander Ansah, who had reportedly forcibly invited himself into the bedroom of Ms. Takyi, and it becomes inescapably glaring that, indeed, it was Mr. Ansah who had invited trouble into his apparently hitherto uneventful existence. Now, what I am not hearing and/or reading enough about are the pontifical voices of those politically heavyweight legally trained rights activist women who promptly went to bat for the members of the infamous Montie-Three Gang, who threatened to sexually violate Chief Justice Georgina Theodora Wood, if the CJ and her Supreme Court associates did not turn a blind eye to widely perceived attempts by the Electoral Commission (EC) to rig Election 2016 in favor of the Mahama regime. \nWell, I am making this observation because it is all too evident that rather than being gratuitously charged for causing serious bodily harm to her repeat rapist and would-be rapist, in the latest incident or instance, Commander Ansah’s victim ought to be rather commended and possibly conferred with a state honor to serve as an emulative example for other young women excruciatingly caught in a similar vulnerable situation, on how to take charge and jealously guard and protect the integrity and chastity of their own bodies from unwanted male predators. It is also time for the Donald Trumps of Ghana to responsibly own up to their pathological sexual perversion, promptly seek psychological counseling and comprehensive therapy to help them straighten up their predatory and misogynistic ways and/or tendencies.

      "text": "EU Bank Opens In Cameroon EU bank opens regional office for Central Africa in Cameroon Oct 21, 2016 tweet \nThe European Investment Bank (EIB), the bank of the European Union, today announced the opening of a representational office that will act as a hub for investment projects in the Central African region. \nAt a ceremony held earlier today the European Investment Bank, Europe’s long-term lending institution, formally opened a permanent regional representation office in Yaoundé, Cameroon. The new office will lead the engagement of the EIB, the world’s largest international public bank, in terms of supporting the development of long-term public and private sector investment in the region in partnership with the EU and managing relations with the national and regional authorities, as well as with the other international organisations based in the Cameroonian capital. \n“The European Investment Bank has a strong track record in supporting crucial investment programmes across Africa and around the world. The opening of an office for the Central Africa region will help us to support crucial investment in infrastructure, water, energy and other key sectors, as well as backing private sector growth, essential for economic development. This is the fifth EIB office in Sub-Saharan Africa, which underlines once more the commitment of the EU bank towards the region, as well as the importance of Cameroon as a central hub in this area. We wish to thank the Cameroonian authorities and our European Delegation colleagues for their invaluable support in creating this office.” said Pim van Ballekom, European Investment Bank Vice-President. \n“The European Investment Bank is the European Union’s bank and the new Yaoundé office will strengthen European support for crucial investment across Cameroon and the Central Africa region in the years to come.” said Ambassador Francoise Collet, Head of the European Union Delegation to Cameroon. \nThe official opening was welcomed by several Ministers of the Cameroonian government. Ambassadors from across Africa and Europe, representatives of other international finance organisations and the business community were also present. \nThe EIB has supported investment in Cameroon since 1965 and last year it provided more than EUR 850 million for investment across Africa. The Bank also introduced Andrea Pinna as head of the new office in Yaoundé. Mr Pinna has many years of professional experience in development banking in projects outside Europe. \nSource: NewsGhana.com.gh  ",

Knox, will undertake his first official visit to Madagascar from 25 to 31 October 2016 to assess how the country is protecting and promoting human rights relating to environmental protection. \n“A healthy environment is essential for the enjoyment of human rights everywhere, but it is of the utmost importance for the protection of human rights in Madagascar, where so much of the population is rural and depends directly on the environment,” the expert stressed. \n“I am looking forward to the visit to Madagascar as a treasure house of ecological diversity, and because it will help to inform my understanding of the relationship of the conservation of biological diversity and the protection of human rights,” said Mr. Knox, who is currently working on a year-long study* on biodiversity and human rights. \nThe Special Rapporteur noted that the Government of Madagascar has made important commitments to protect human rights related to the environment. Its Environmental Charter states that everyone has the fundamental right to live in a healthy and balanced environment, and specifically recognizes several rights such as rights to information, participation and access to justice as well as the impacts that environmental harm can have on social and economic aspects of life. \n“I will assess, in particular, the lessons learned and challenges faced in the country with regard to realisation of environmental rights, as well as how it is addressing environmental challenges with human rights impacts such as climate change, deforestation, and the loss of biological diversity,” he said. \nDuring his seven-day visit, at the invitation of the Government, the human rights expert will meet Government officials and experts, as well as representatives of civil society. \nMr. Knox will present his preliminary observations on the visit at a press conference on the last day of the mission, Monday 31 October at 11:30, in Salle de réunion Titan II, Maison Commune des Nations Unies, Zone Galaxy, Rue du Dr Raseta, Andraharo, Antananarivo 101. Access to the press conference is strictly limited to journalists. \nThe Special Rapporteur will present a comprehensive report to the UN Human Rights Council in 2017. \nDistributed by APO on behalf of Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).

      "text": "Ghandi Statue Removal: Francis Kwarteng writes to Okoampa The Gandhi Statue Removal Petition Had Nothing To Do With J.B. Danquah 2 Oct 21, 2016 \n“I have learned to hate all traitors, and there is no disease that I spit on more than treachery” (Aeschylus). \nCONTRADICTION OF THE CENURY: AFROCENTRIC DANQUAH VERSUS KWAME OKOAMPA-AHOOFE, AN UNABASHED DEFENDER OF AFROCENTRISTS \nPerhaps the most laughable—if not comical—aspect of journalist Kwame Okoampa-Ahoofe is the Afrocentric label he attaches to Danquah. In fact on Ghanaweb and other web portals he wrote a two-part article, titled “Boko Haram Scholars and King Kongi,” a direct titular reference to Afrocentric philosophers, scholars and writers. Today, thanks to this same yellow journalist called Kwame Okoampa-Ahoofe, Danquah now qualifies to wear the “Boko Haram—King Kongi Scholar” mortarboard! \nWhy has it taken this yellow journalist this long to come to this conclusion about Danquah? How can a “Boko Haram—King Kongi Scholar” become an “acclaimed philosopher”? \nWhile he appears on Ghanaweb and other web portals with poorly written articles, from the point of view of the low quality research foundation of his write-ups, to miseducate and deceive his unsuspecting readership, Kwame Okoampa-Ahoofe does not tell this readership, that, the Theory of Afrocentricity and Afrocentric scholars played an important role in his graduate education as well as in his doctoral dissertation, which he titled “Atumpan: A Critical Analysis Of Twentieth-Century Ghanaian Anglophone Poetry (1998).” \nKWAME OKOAMPA-AHOOFE IN DEFENSE OF THE THEORY OF AFROCENTRICITY, OF AFROCENTRISTS \nWhat is more, his New York Times article (1999) “When Human Dignity is Besieged: An Afrocentric Critique of the Diary of Anne Frank” is, ironically, itself based on the Theory of Afrocentricity as is implied in the title (this article appeared on the Letters Column of the New York Times). Moreover, he would author a couple or so articles and hand them to academics—editors he now calls “Boko Haram—King Kongi Scholars” for them to be published in an Afrocentric peer-reviewed journal, the Journal of Black Studies, co-founded by Molefi Kete Asante! \nThen also he would author a whole book “The New Scapegoats: Colored-On-Black Racism” to critique Henry Louis Gates, Jr., the Harvard-based anti-Afrocentric scholar. Here is just one way Kwame Okoampa-Ahoofe went on the attack in defense of Afrocentric scholars and of the Theory of Afrocentricity (our emphasis): \n“In fact, he [Henry Louis Gates, Jr.] unabashedly called himself a cultural and genetic hybrid. He also routinely made vitriolic remarks against the Afrocentrists, and, in fact, it was hybrid intellectuals like Skip Gates who convinced some right-wing White-Americans to equate the Theory of Afrocentricity with Minister Louis Farrakhan’s branch of the Nation of Islam. \n“During the 1980s and 1990s, for instance, Gates snobbishly portrayed the Afrocentrists, particularly the Temple University School spear-headed by Molefi Kete Asante, as a band of pseudo-scholars and pharaoh’s of a patently fabricated ancient African civilization.” \nElsewhere he dismissively referred to Gates as “A Feeding Bottle Theorist” and “Mainstream America’s Sonny Liston.” Significantly, Gates American Book Award-winning text (1989) “The Signifying Monkey: A Theory of African-American Literary Criticism,” perhaps his well-known work among literary scholars, borrowed heavily from the Theory of Afrocentricity and the work of Molefi Kete Asante in particular (see Wahneema Lubiano’s paper “Henry Louis Gates, Jr. And African-American Literary Discourse” in “Black Literature Criticism Supplement.” Eds: Jerry Moore & Jefrrey Hunter”). \nIn fact Gates’ blurb praise for Asante’s influential text—“The Afrocentric Idea”—went as follows: \n“Asante’s wide range of references, his delightful examples taken from black traditions, and his sheer pleasure at discussing black culture, all combine to make his argument both cogent and important. This will be a major book.” \nIn other words, Asante’s Theory of Afrocentricity which borrows from Nkrumah’s own work contributed to Gates’ influence today, as exemplified by his influential text “The Signifying Monkey.” The Theory of Afrocentricity is one of the most influential theories in the world today. Yet, Gates, like Molefi Kete Asante, represents one of the heavyweights in the American Academy! Nobody knows Kwame Okoampa-Ahoofe as he occupies the neglected periphery even of the Ghanaian Academy! His popularity is being the “Putative Doyen Of Ghanaweb Yellow Journalists”! \nToday, the Theory of Afrocentrity has permeated the American Academy and society in a way no one seemed to have anticipated. Asian scholars are borrowing ideas from the theory just as feminist studies have done. It is even a global phenomenon. Moreover, Gates (and his scholarship), like Kwame Anthony Appiah (and his scholarship), are widely known around the world for their scholarship, while the largely self-published works of some of our unproductive pseudo-scholar journalists are completely ignored in any serious academy because they lack value. \nOn the other hand Dr. Dompere, one of the leading Nkrumah scholars in the world and the American Academy, is ranked among the “World’s Top 100 Leading Thinkers” while Molefi Kete Asante, the world’s leading Afrocentric theorist and an Nkrumah scholar himself, has also been ranked among the “100 Leading Thinkers in America.” These are the kind of academics and thinkers whose ideas are moving the world. \nIt is partly the works and ideas of Nkrumah that have propelled the likes of Dompere and Asante onto the world stage! The journalist Kwame Okoampa-Ahoofe’s own works have benefited from the Theory of Afrocentricity. \nThe insults Kwame Okoampa-Ahoofe showered on Gates are the same insults he is now showering on Afrocentrists today. On Ghanaweb he has turned himself into another Gates, an unabashed enemy of Afrocentrists and of the Theory of Afrocentricity. One has to be seriously sick in the head, to be schizophrenic for that matter, to insult Afrocentric scholars and academics and the Theory of Afrocentricity, only to turn around and appropriate the Afrocentric title for one’s idol. \nSince when did it become useful, even fashionable, to appropriate the word “Afrocentric” for J.B. Danquah? Doesn’t that make Danquah a “Boko Haram—King Kongi Scholar”? \nIt is sad, even regrettable that while Afocentrists approach race relations, the sociology of knowledge, history and morality, human psychology, and the like from an essentialist viewpoint and methodology, others employ similar—if not the same—tools of essentialism to promote bigotry, ethnocentrism, hatred, ethnic hatred, and poor journalism. This is not what progressive African-centeredness is about! \nTHE FOUNDING OF THE UNIVERSITY OF GHANA \nAs for your reactionary Prof. Robert Addo-Fening the less said about him and his revisionist history, the better. His writing on the subject never even bother to detail the yeoman’s job Joseph Ephraim Casely Hayford (Ekra-Agiman) Hayford, one of J.B. Danquah’s foremost mentors and teachers, and other West Africans from the Sierra Leonean Dr. Africanus Horton (1835-1883)…I have written about this before. Here: \n“In 1911, Casely-Hayford took up Dr. Africanus Horton’s proposals for a West African University, and rather campaigned for a university for the Gold Coast. Nine years later, the National Congress of British West Africa, led by Casely-Hayford, petitioned the British Government ‘to found a British West African University on such lines as would preserve in the students a sense of African nationality… \n“This request yielded no positive response until 1945, when the Colonial Government finally embraced the idea of a university for the Gold Coast. This change of attitude was based on two separate reports submitted to the Colonial Government by Asquith and Elliot Commissions. Contained in the reports, the mission of the university was to train a new platonic African elite… \n“Importantly, the National Congress of British West Africa (NCBWA) was founded by JE Casely-Hayford, Kobina Sekyi, A. Sawyer, Thomas Hutton-Mills, Sr., A.B. Quartey-Papafio, Edward F. Small, Henry van Hien, and F.V. Nanka-Bruce. Admittedly, J.E. Casely-Hayford did the groundwork for the establishment of a university in the then-Gold Coast. Of course, Dr. JB Danquah did his part, though tangentially, and, as a result, as history consciously and eloquently informs the world, the seminal idea of establishing such a university in the then-Gold Coast was certainly not Danquah’s. \n“Particularly, this view is not debatable because of an obscure historical link between the two, Casely-Hayford and Danquah, with a palpable degree of overbearing tutelage which the former dutifully exerted on the latter, a political neophyte at that! Nana Ofori Atta Ayim writes of this obscure relationship: \n“‘Dr. Danquah was a protégé of the celebrated and iconic God-father of West African nationalism and the pioneer Pan-Africanist, Joseph Ephraim Casely-Hayford. In his own words, it was at the feet of the eminent nationalist, ‘Ekra Agyemang…’” \nIn other words, it was through his association with Casely-Hayford that Danquah learned about the former’s (and his colleagues’) exploits in having a university in the West African sub-region, although Casely-Hayford “rather campaigned for a university for the Gold Coast.” This piece of important history is largely missing from Prof. Robert Addo-Fening’s writings on the subject. \nImportantly, then, there were so many ideas Danquah picked up from Casely-Hayford and the other Fante leaders, ideas that brought him into political and philosophical maturity, yet a topic we will not get into! They have been extensively covered in many scholarly works. At the end of the day it was the government of Nkrumah that built the University of Ghana, as Danquah was never a member of this government! \nCONCLUSION: THE NATURE OF THE CONTROVERSY \nOf course, Danquah did go to London at the head of a delegation on the later University of Ghana question. The question then becomes: What role did the other members of this delegation play? \nYes, when it is about those who fought for Ghana’s independence journalists such Kwame Okoampa-Ahoofe wants Danquah to have a share in that glory. \nBut when it comes to whose yeomanly struggles would eventually lay the foundation for the establishment of the University of Ghana, the likes of J.E. Casely-Hayford, Africanus Hortons…and several others are totally excluded from the scholarship! \nIn this context, Prof. Addo-Fening’s writings on the subject are not authoritative as they ignore this essential part of the long history of the University of Ghana coming into being. \nFOOD FOR THOUGHT \nThere are those whose writings rather than adding to the body of knowledge, subtracts from the body of knowledge. Their ethnocentric agitprop writings do not advance nation-building, the scientific and humanistic development of society, and refinement of the mind. \nSuch impulsive, reactionary writings with their ideological bankruptcies potentially threaten the very foundation and survival of the human race, worsen the human condition, and starve impressionable minds of quality education. \nThe idea of critical, analytic and scientific intellection and mentation is foreign to them, as it were beyond their reach because they have allowed hatred, ethnocentrism and bigotry to invade their value judgments, to cloud their sense of social justice, and to impair their sense of intellectual honesty. \nThat is primary why their body of work has no instrumentalist value in the contemporary history of ideas, as well as lacking operational usefulness for development economics, ethnic relations, and development sociology. \nSuch agitprop schizophrenics with their sensational revisionisms have no place in the modern academy of the twenty-first century, given that their corpus of writings can best be described as a potboiler and given that they primarily write not to educate and inform but rather to feed and satiate their egoistical tomfoolery and low self-esteem. They write to impoverish impressionable minds for the most part. \nThese writers and journalists find comfort in the excruciating hyperbole of auctorial intemperance and self-worth only in exaggerated verbiage while progressive, scientific, analytic and critical informational content escape their potboiler writings. On this basis of this fact their ideas are stuck in the stone-age of intellectual backwardness, while their intellectually productive colleagues take them for mere dinosaurs in the history of ideas. \nGhana deserves better. Africa deserves. We can do better for Ghana and Africa if we encourage men and women of great ideas, of refined temperaments, of patriotic vision, and of scientific bearings to take charge of affairs. Again, while the Chinese are working on putting man on the moon six years from now, we are fighting over each other by way of excessive adjectivization of partisan politics and historical revisionism and of overexploitation of split infinitives without regard for the analytic content of technocratic—scientific and technological, or industrial—vision! \nFurthermore, writing and reviewing books for the Amsterdam News and having a couple of articles published in peer-reviewed journals, for instance, does not put one in the same class of great writers from Toni Morrison, Derek Walcott, Doris Lessing, J.M. Coetzee, Pearl Buck, James Hemmingway, Nadine Gordimer, Gabriel Garcia, Ben Okri, Orhan Pamuk, Naguib Mahfouz, William Faulkner, Buchi Emecheta, and Leo Tolstoy to Wole Soyinka (Note: We have friends who work for are associated with the Amsterdam News in various capacities)! \nFor far too long, we have allowed unabashed demagogues to define and adulterate the language of political and moral discourse. \nWe shall return with Part 3! \nBy Francis Kwarteng  ",

      "text": "NDC, The Cause of Ghana’s Debt?-Nana Kyei Baffour Writes Blame President Mahama's NDC For Ghana's Calamitous Debt And Economy Oct 21, 2016 tweet \nGhana is not among the most popular destination to set up business. The few entrepreneurs and investors we have had were attracted to the country due to it’s natural resources as well as the fact that English is the language of the Ghanaian business world. \nGovernments for decades have not had great and attractive investment policies and guidelines to support and entice investors; both local and foreign. \nI won’t minced words on the industrious and well- educated workforce who now have turned useless and unemployed in the name of politricks and some nasty IMF bailout programme. \nWith or without a Business degree or Business education background, most Ghanaians are naturally born “Business genius”. We are proud as Ghanaians and our pride extends to the nations natural resources which are the country’s main exports. \nWhat happens to our gold, oil, cocoa, beans, cashews, corn, plantain, cassava, timber, Aluminum, Manganese ore, diamonds and the horticultures? \nWhere are the factories and the jobs..? \nIn relation to ease of doing business, the country is now ranked 114th out of 189 countries included the World Banks Ease of doing business survey. \nGhana imports mostly consumer goods and foodstuffs and yet the country’s economy is predominantly agricultural, with 60% of the population engaged in subsistence agriculture. And this is really sad . \nIn 2013, the Bank of Ghana reported; the country imports estimated at $4515.06 million which was all time high with exports estimated at $2931.7 million in July 2013. In 2014, the dollar started swallowing the cedi and thereafter frightened lots of businesses so importation declined to $3413.22 million with $3583.4 million of exports. \nA turning point where every Economist will smile and explain the trade magic that meant , we were selling our own products which is a profit to us and buying less supplies or materials to support the economy, the Government started borrowing unnecessarily which we had to repay the loan with high interest. \nIn 2015, exports declined to $2525.5 million falling behind imports estimated at $3279.88 same year. \nPresident John Dramani Mahama’s Consistent borrowing which was NOT wisely used to build factories to produce and create jobs or invested in private sector businesses or solved the energy crisis(dumsor) in 2015 resulted so many existed businesses to run into liquidation. \nGovernment budget of about GH9.58 billion as interest payment on debt alone which is more than what could raise from external loans and grants of GH8.3 billion is an evidence that, President Mahama and NDC government have failed Ghanaians and may lead the country into a calamitous situation if voted in power for the second term. \nThe increase in unemployment rate especially among the youth in the country over the past years is as a result of bad leadership, poor trading policies, corruption and government inability to feel the pain of the individual Ghanaian electorates. \nA government borrowing more should be able to invest in private sector businesses with grants and also build factories to increase production and also create jobs for the graduated youths. Critical analysis shows opposite of what the NDC government is doing and they must be blamed for the country’s crummy economy and depressed businesses. \nDue to high taxes on goods and custom duties on imported and exported supplies in 2016 and local businesses NOT producing and government inability to support private sector businesses , exports declined to $2552.5 million and imports maintaining it’s $3279.88 million this year resulted in the 9% increase of cost of food in September. And yet the government receive praises of poverty alleviation and transforming lives. \nWith the above indications, common sense tell us that, Ghana’s economic challenges are not unsolvable nightmares and once the Government put fixes in place to support local businesses and build factories, increasing rate of unemployment will be a thing of the past. \nTo solve the problem, Government should invest in building regional market centers along with factories which will effectively increase production, create jobs, increase exportation and decrease importation in order to compete in the international market. \nEven though , foreign investors see Ghana as a good investment destination in terms of political stability and the medium term prospects of the economy but there are yet other significant investment guidelines and support the government should put in place to attract them. A word to the wise is enough. \nBy Nana Kyei Baffour  ",

      "text": "The Swedish Academy’s Surprise Definition of Literature Oct 21, 2016 tweet \n“By the time he was 23, Bob’s voice, with its weight, its unique, gravelly power was redefining not just what music sounded like, but the message it carried and how it made people feel. Today, everybody from Bruce Springsteen to U2 owes Bob a debt of gratitude” (Barack Obama). \n“Bob Dylan is a genius, and for his genius, he’s been rewarded in every way; with fame, money, acclaim. He deserves all of it, but he doesn’t deserve the Nobel…The objection here hinges in the definition of the word ‘literature.’ You wouldn’t give the literary prize to an economist or a political saint. You shouldn’t give it to Bob Dylan (Stephen Metcalf). \nBOB DYLAN AND THE FACE OF MYSTERY \nThe Swedish Academy, which is responsible for selecting Nobel Laureates in Literature, this year, 2016, has nominated Bob Dylan, an American singer, writer, songwriter and musician whose music genres run from folk, rock, gospel, and blues to country, for the prestigious award with the following citation for his: \n“Having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.” \nAlready the world of literature is abuzz with a mixture of confusion, excitement, and utter shock. \nThe obvious question then becomes: \nWhy did the Swedish Academy ignore such great writers from Leo Tolstoy, Chinua Achebe, Arthur Miller, perennial nominee Nuruddin Farah, Mark Twain, Jorge L. Borges, Robert Frost, Henry James, Marcel Proust, James Joyce, Primo Levi, Philip Roth, George Orwell, Vladimir Nabokov, Wystan H. Auden, and Virginia Woolf to John Updike? \nThis question is sometimes difficult to answer as information on possible answers is shrouded in mystery in accordance with regulations set forth in motion by the Norwegian Nobel Committee. \nThis information is, however, declassified fifty years following the prestigious prize being awarded to a selected nominee. \nA NECESSARY DIVERSION: SOME IMPORTANT POINTS TO TAKE NOTE OF \nMeanwhile, others have speculated that the Swedish Academy is too Eurocentric when it never considered Chinua Achebe for the Prize. \nBut this speculation flies in the face of the Prize being given to Toni Morrison, Wole Soyinka, and Derek Walcott. \nWe do know for a fact that Henry Louis Gates, Jr. may have played some role in Soyinka’s nomination (a high-profile American academic who is a colleague of both Gates and Soyinka confided in us). \nSignificantly, Soyinka has admitted in an interview that his being awarded the 1986 Nobel Prize in Literature may explain some of the tensions between him and Achebe. \nFinally, Nellie Yvonne McKay’s text “Critical Essays on Toni Morrison” brought the work of Toni Morrison to the attention of the Swedish Academy. \nIt was actually the Jamaican-American woman of letters who was first offered the position Gates occupies now at Harvard University, a position she turned down and instead asked that it be given to Gates. Gates would later assemble a world-class faculty including Wole Soyinka, he and Appiah’s professor and academic advisor at Cambridge University, Kwame Anthony Appiah, the brilliant Ghanaian writer, historian and editor Emmanuel Acheampong, Cornel West among others. \nAcheampong played an instrumental role in creating the Department of African/African-American Studies. The six-volume “Dictionary of African Biography” is edited by him and Gates. Gates co-authored “The Anthology of African American Literature” and “The Future of the Race” with Nellie and West respectively, and with Appiah edited “The Dictionary of Global Culture” and the first edition of “Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience” (see Molefi Kete Asante’s “Microsoft Encarta Africana Edited by Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Anthony Appiah” for his critique of this latter volume at www.asante.net). \nAnd, last but not least, it was Soyinka who advised Gates to read literature if he wanted to impact an impact in race relations. His important work “The Signifying Monkey” would revolve around Soyinka’s interpretation of Yoruba culture, cosmology-cosmogony, art, philosophy, history among other useful topics. \nLastly, Gates then built the department around the progressive ideals and philosophy of America’s pre-eminent urban sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois, a literary giant whose intellectual, moral and social philosophy Appiah tried to deconstruct in his controversial work, “In My Father’s House” (Read: W.E.B. Du Bois at the Hutchins Center). In this book Appiah was also highly critical of Soyinka, his mentor! Also in the late 1990s, for instance, Gates campaigned/lobbied for Du Bois to be named Time Magazine’s Man of the Century! \nBOB DYLAN AND THE SILENT CONTROVERSY \nEssentially, Dylan was not the first musician to be nominated for the prestigious prize. The first was Rabindranath Tagore, a Bengali musician, poet, painter, writer, film composer, and visual artist. The Swedish Academy awarded him the 1913 Nobel Prize in Literature (citation): \n“Because of his profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse, by which, with consummate skill, he has made his poetic thought, expressed in his own English words, a part of the literature of the West.” \nThen also, Alex Lubet, Morse Alumni Distinguished Teaching Professor of Music and Adjunct Professor of American Studies, University of Minnesota, writes of Tagore: \n“The Nobel website states that Tagore, though he wrote in many genres, was principally a poet who published more than 50 volumes of verse, as well as plays, short stories, and novels. Tagore’s music isn’t mentioned until the last sentence, which says that the artist ‘also left… songs for which he wrote the music himself,’ as if this much-loved body of work was no more than an afterthought. \n“But with over 2,000 songs to his name, Tagore’s output of music alone is extremely impressive. Many continue to be used in films, while three of his songs were chosen as national anthems by India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, an unparalleled achievement. \n“Today, Tagore’s significance as a songwriter is undisputed.” \nBut Tagore was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature, not for the kind of recognition the Swedish Academy has extended Dylan, although Prof. Lubet draws some striking parallels between the careers of both men. \nThat said, Prof. Lubet also cites an unsubstantiated rumor that claims Dylan was “first nominated in 1996” for the Nobel Prize in Literature. \nThis implies that the Swedish Academy may have been wrestling with the idea of awarding the Nobel Prize in Literature to Dylan. \nHowever, we cannot make much of this speculation without the benefit of verifiable supporting evidence. \nIt is nevertheless interesting to see how some experts are already drawing some parallels between Dylan’s musical language and the language of Homer’s epic poetry/poetic narrative (see his “Odyssey” and “Iliad”). \nTo make the spice up the controversy, others have also gone as far saying the Greek lyric poet Sappho, one of the so-called Nine (Melic) Poets would have endorsed the Swedish Academy for awarding Dylan the prestigious prize were she alive today. \nIt is interesting knowing that two Homer scholars, Albert Lord and Milman Parry, demonstrated that the epic poetry of Homer was based on or originated in the oral traditions (or oral lore) of his Greek community, which also means, among other extrapolations, that what later came to be known as “Iliad” and “Odyssey” were, in fact, in oral forms before were collected in book forms. \nThere have also been subtle references to the lyric poetry of Ancient Greece. At least not everyone agrees with this characterization (Scott Timberg): \n“And most of Dylan’s lyrics don’t stand up terribly well as poetry…Slate’s Stephen Metcalf makes a well-argued case, which I am at least partially sympathetic to, that his songs aren’t really poetry at all.” \nThe above notwithstanding, so far, we have not come to any information where the poetic language of Dylan’s music is compared to Nobel Laureate Derek Walcott’s three-hundred-page-plus “Omeros (1990).” \nIs this prestigious recognition bestowed on Dylan, a raconteur and rhapsodist, on the basis of what the Ugandan scholar, literary theorist, and linguist Pio Zirimu called “orature” (“oral literature”)? Thus far, no controversy has greeted this announcement as it did in the case of President Obama, Henry Kissinger, Wangari Maathai, or Yasser Arafat! \nWhatever the reasons for Dylan’s nomination which we might get to know in fifty years from now (2066) if the Norwegian Nobel Committee does not change or revise its regulations on its classified archives/database, the fact still remains that he is still the 2016 recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature. \nLet us remember that thirty years after Soyinka had been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, the debates still continues in parts of the African world, unabated, why it did not go to Achebe instead, or why Achebe was not awarded one. There were even calls for Soyinka to recommend the Nobel Prize in Literature for his colleague in 2013! Here is Soyinka’s stinging riposte to the callers: \n“Let us quit this indecent exercise of fatuous plaints, including raising hopes, even now, with talk of ‘posthumous’ conferment, when you know damned well that the Nobel committee does not indulge in such tradition. It has gone beyond ‘sickening.’ It is obscene and irreverent. It desecrates memory. \n“This conduct is gross disservice to Chinua Achebe and disrespectful of the life-engrossing occupation known as literature. How did creative valuation descend to such banality? Do these people know what they’re doing—they are inscribing Chinua’s epitaph in the negative mode of thwarted expectations. I find that disgusting.” \n“…What the literary enterprise is about? Was it the Nobel that spurred a young writer, stung by Eurocentric portrayal of African reality, to put pen to paper and produce ‘Things Fall Apart’? \n“Chinua is entitled to better than being escorted to his grave with that monotonous, hypocritical aria of deprivation’s lament, orchestrated by those who, as we say in my part of the world, ‘dye their mourning weeds a deeper indigo than those of the bereaved’. He deserves his peace. Me too! And right now, not posthumously.” \nCONCLUDING THOUGHTS \n“These songs of mine, they’re like mystery plays, the kind that Shakespeare saw when he was growing up. I think you could trace what I do back that far. They were on the fringes then, and I think they’re on the fringes now. And they sound like they’ve been on the hard ground” (Bob Dylan). \nThose of our writers who are aiming for the Nobel Prize in Literature should know henceforth that “literature” means many things to the Swedish Academy. It means more than what one writes, to encompass what and how one writes what one sings (“sheet music”). \nIronically, unlike Bob Dylan, Wole Soyinka, a musician and guitarist in his own right, fortunately won the prestigious prize not for his maverick musicianship but for his complex narrative literature, drama specifically. The irony, if we should add, is that the Swedish Academy is not even getting any response from Dylan whether or not he is going to formally accept the award. \nLet us not ignore the fact that Dylan is a writer as well. In fact his partially flavored stream-of-consciousness novel, “Tarantula,” reminds us of the works of Ben Okri, Salman Rushdie, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, and a memoir “Chronicles: Volume 1”! \nThose of us who have and been listening to his music know he is a great songwriter with a powerful gravelly voice known for its strong semblance of an eloquent language of lyric poetry. \nREFERENCES \nLisa Respers France.

      "text": "ATC Ghana Supports Rangoon Camp Junior High and Basic Schools ATC Ghana Donates Science Kits & Equipment to The Exploratory at Rangoon Camp Junior High and Basic Schools Oct 21, 2016 tweet \nVolunteers from ATC Ghana arrived at the Rangoon Camp Junior High School (JHS) for their 2nd Mini CSR initiative for 2016 on 23rd September. This was a special occasion as this is ATC Ghana’s 5th Anniversary and employees generously made voluntary cash donation which was used to purchase story books for the school in addition to the Company’s contributions of science equipment’s and learning materials. \nATC Ghana presented the donation, in collaboration with The Exploratory, a Ghana-based NGO that aims to make science, technology, engineering and mathematics education, also known as STEM, more relevant, joyful, collaborative and equitable to girls. By this collaborative effort, both organizations anticipate that the students at Rangoon Camp JHS will experience their science lessons in a completely new way this school year and beyond. \nMr. Alfred Odamey, Head teacher of Rangoon Camp JHS welcomed the volunteers from ATC Ghana and expressed delight about the program. Mrs Sheila Adjin-Tettey ATC Ghana’s Project Manager for this CSR programme formally introduced the students to ATC’s business and encouraged them to study hard and actively participate in the activities for the day. \nVolunteers took the students through reading and communication skills clinic, presentation of information using Microsoft PowerPoint and a discussion on social media and its effects on education. \n“We are happy to complement the exciting and commendable work of The Exploratory by giving students and teachers the learning materials and resources to engage students with STEM in a practical way,” said Letitia Asiedu-Attafuah, Head of Human Resources at ATC Ghana. “ATC takes great pride in our various philanthropic initiatives which are led by our valued employees and this demonstrates our commitment to sustainable initiatives in all our communities”. \nThe Rangoon Camp Schools is a government school situated amongst the well-resourced private schools in the Cantonment area. \nThis August, four teachers from the Rangoon Camp JHS and Primary Schools joined over 50 teachers from schools in Accra, Pokuase, Nsawam and Berekuso, where The Exploratory’s clubs are held, on a 3-day training. \n“I learnt about electronics, about building anatomical models of the body with simple materials, and how to support the girl-child in learning”, said Mrs. Diana Tetteh, a science teacher at the Rangoon Camp JHS. “It was fun and educative. That’s the spirit that I now want to bring to my students”. \nATC’s global philanthropic signature program, introduced in 2011, focuses on sponsoring initiatives that improve education through technology. Around the globe, ATC employees are leading projects dedicated to furthering this initiative through partnerships with local schools and organizations. \n“We already have a relationship with the ATC Ghana, where our students visited their offices for a career day in July 2015,” said Mr. Odamey. “The Exploratory brings expertise and inspiration to our teachers and students. We look forward to this partnership developing and to creating a well-resourced STEM lab, so even more students can benefit”. \n“Together, we can nurture the scientists, engineers and technologists of tomorrow that are necessary for Ghana’s development”, Mr. Odamey continued. \nAbout The Exploratory \nThe Exploratory is an NGO based in Ghana, with a support team in the United States. The mission of The Exploratory disrupts rote learning by making science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) more relevant, joyful, collaborative, and equitable. The organization provides teacher training, provides learning resources and facilitates clubs, field trips and role model visits for students to promote practical learning and gender equity. In the 2016-2017 school year, The Exploratory will inspire over 600 students in 13 schools, in Accra, Berekuso, Pokuase and Nsawam, through 60 teachers in upper primary and JHS. \nSource: NewsGhana.com.gh  ",

      "text": "Christianity Vs Ghana’s Entertainment The Impact Crew: “Charismatic Witchcraft'' Oct 21, 2016 tweet \nIndeed, this issue has made me suffer from insomnia for sometime now, however, I’m left with no choice than to express my worry about it through words. Religion defined from the psychological point of view by James L. Coz which was put into collection by Ferguson will clearly show that, “it’s the result of seeking comfort in a world which, dispassionately considered, is a kind of terrifying wilderness”. \nFor the purpose of clarity and evidence, I’ll limit my argument to the happenings in Christianity in reference to the Ghanaian entertainment setting. From our basic schools, pupils were exposed to the need to look up to some people in the society whom he/she can be used as a roadmap to achieve greatness. Fast forward, the idea of role model was established at that tender age in the hearts of Ghanaian students. Role model are people who have excelled in the various fields and their lives basically serve as a motivation to the upcoming ones. Ghanaians have witnessed an uncountable number of celebrities who have come to spice our television screens from the days of Dr. Kwame Nkrumah till now. However, the issue is that, after misleading the masses to emulate their lifestyle both the ugly and the good, religion becomes the medium where they finally seek refuge at a point when their career has died from the system. \nGhanaian entertainment industry particularly music has gone through series of revolutions starting from the time of Nana Kwame Ampadu and his African Brothers Band International who took the nation by surprise with the Hi-life genre. With time, a new dimension headed by Nana Acheampong, Lee Duodu, A. B Crentsil among others in the late 80’s with their Borga Hi-life when the 83 hunger struck through the length and breadth of this nation. Charles Kwadwo Fosu, popularly know as Daddy Lumba also took the music baton and gave Ghanaians value for their money whenever he organize music show. Time changes, a new generation of creative minds burst into the music scene and rebranded the genre with fast rhythmic flows and instrumentals which in any day sound good to every listening ears. Reggie Rockstone deserves to be applauded here for being the propagator of hip-life although Gyedu Blay Amboley use to challenge him in terms of the real inventor of this genre. Nonetheless, some artiste like Obrafour, Obour, Okyeame Kwame, Okomfour Kwaadɛɛ, Lord Kenya, K. K Fosu, Ofori Amponsah among others have paid their dues well by blending sense with rhythm in the hip-life music genre. Nowadays, most of the contemporary music artiste in the system are pulling all the crowds and the cash without considering the content in their rap, therefore making less sense as compared to their predecessors. \nAs earlier said, the celebrities are to live a life worthy of emulation to be copied by the younger generation. But the story is different in this county. We’ve had so many celebrities who in their hay-days never thought of repenting. They spent all their time and energy organising music shows, clubbing and chasing different shades of women. For the purpose of clarity, I’ll cite Lord Kenya who in the early 2000’s lived a luxurious lifestyle and abused narcotic drugs like cocaine. He tagged himself the rap heavyweight champion and produced hit songs after hit songs in those times. He ruled the rap scene until he decided to give his life to Christ at a point in time when his music career was fading! Why didn’t he repented when he was acclaimed the rap heavyweight in Ghana? Likewise, Ofori Amponsah also burst into the music scene and was labeled the Highlife King who release hits after hits just like his predecessor. As my mum has always been telling me, “all days are not equal”, a time came in the music career of Ofori Amponsah when he wasn’t getting the needed attention as it used to be. He was quick to employ a face saving mechanism by pronouncing his encounter with Jesus Christ. He went further to establish his own church. Sadly, because he wasn’t making money as he used to get as compared to when he was in the “profane” world, he quickly renounced his faith and came back to release another Hi-life track titled alewa (sweet toffee) featuring Sarkodie. This gave him the title “Pastor Alewa” as Ghanaians were trying to make fun of him. The list goes on to include Timothy Bentum, Papa Shee, Yaw Siki, Akoo Nana, Azigizar Jnr, Nii Soul and many others who all run into Christianity at a time when their impact in the Ghanaian Music Industry was of less significance. \nRecently, a crop of music stars are into the system who’re leading the youth into an undesirable path. Notable among them are Sarkodie, Shatta Wale, Stonebwoy, Pappy Kojo, Joey B, Criss Wadle, Opanka and most of the contemporary artistes. Nowadays, the fashion trend in the country is getting crazier each and every day as a result of the “misleading” impact of Pappy Kojo and Joey B in particular. Pappy started to showcase different crazy and tight fitting (pencil-jeans) costumes in his music videos. However, because these people appear constantly on our screens, their impacts are high as most people are tempted to take them as their models. Likewise, Sarkodie and M.anifest also bearded themselves, and within a twinkle of an eye, Ghanaian youths are copying blindly. Dade Opanka on the other side left his hair untrimmed, and fast forward, the youths are initiating such acts. Now the issue is, why won’t they repent at this moment when their music career is strong but wait till their career is fading before they pronounce repentance on themselves? Recently, actor Majid Michel and music director/actor Pascal Amanfo, who’s known for the popular music video titled “kaalu” by E.L are doing the work of God. I asked myself, why now? Why didn’t Majid Michel repent at the time when he was caressing all the beautiful ladies in the movie? Why didn’t he search for salvation at that time, but now that he’s no longer active in the movie scene? \nTo pen down my thoughts, I’ve the conviction that the religious people who’ll read this article will attributes everything to God’s appointed time in the life of humanity. However, must it always be the case for people to live their lives anyhow, and when their relevance are no more important, then they try to seek refuge in Christ? I wonder the number of souls who will be lost by the time Sarkodie, Shatta Wale, Stonebwoy and the rest will finally decided to seek for salvation. Most people have go in for tattoo in order to be like their favourite celebrities. Ask yourself, do you know the number of people who have died in their evil ways as a result of imitating Lord Kenya in his hay-days? Sadly, the enthusiasm and the zeal at which Lord Kenya used to do the rap music in the early 2000’s is somehow low as compared to his gospel songs, but the worst of all the Christian converts is Ofori Amponsah affectionately called “Pastor Alewa”. Likewise, Daddy Lumba on his sick bed professed the name of the Lord and even composed a gospel song titled, “Mɛsom Jesus”( I’ll worship Jesus), however, he quickly went back into his formal ways as Ofori Amponsah and Akoo Nana did. If this is the trend, whereby our celebrities decide to use temporal conversion into Christianity as a means of hiding from public disgrace, then there must be something wrong somewhere! It’s my fervent hope that the majority of Ghanaians wish to see their celebrities living a life worthy of emulation devoid of evil. Therefore, if they have it in mind to search for salvation, the time is now. They shouldn’t wait until the time when their careers are fading before coming out publicly to tell us stories of no substance. \nBy Adu Sarpeah  ",

Sadly, among them are the bodies of five people who perished before rescuers could reach the first boat in distress. \n“We received a call to assist in the rescue of a wooden boat in distress,” said Gillian Moyes, Save the Children’s team leader on the Vos Hestia. “When we arrived on the scene, five people had already died. The bodies and the survivors were transferred onto our ship from a navy vessel.” \nThe Vos Hestia was then called to assist in a second rescue, which took place over several hours at night. In total, more than 200 people were brought on board, including pregnant women, and a large number of lone children and families with children as young as one year old. \nIn total, more than 200 people were brought on board, including pregnant women, and a large number of lone children and families with children as young as one year old \n“This tragic event once again highlights the dangers faced by those crossing the Mediterranean Sea to seek the safety of Europe,” added Ms. Moyes. \n“So far in 2016, more than 3,600 people have drowned while attempting this treacherous journey. The continuing loss of life clearly shows how search and rescue operations capacity must be a primary focus of the European response to save all lives at risk.” \nSave the Children has provided fresh water, food and blankets to everyone on board. The survivors of the first rescue, in particular, are being assisted by the medical and child protection teams to ensure they receive the specific support they need following such a harrowing event. \nVos Hestia will arrive at the port of Catania in Sicily on October 21. Save the Children staff will be present to help with the disembarkation process and will continue to work to ensure children have access to their basic needs and rights.

      "text": "Dormaa Central Assembly Builds Educational Facilities Oct 21, 2016 tweet \nAs part effort to improve and increase access to education in the Dormaa Central Municipality in the Brong Ahafo region the Assembly over the past four years has been spending millions of Ghana cedis on educational infrastructure. \nThe Municipal Chief Executive, Gordon Asubonteng in an exclusive interview noted that construction of classroom blocks, teacher’s bungalows, dining and assembly halls have been the main projects being executed. \nAccording to him, improving access to quality of education at all levels within the Dormaa Central Municipality has been the main agenda of the assembly under his leadership. \n“More resources have been put into getting 16 classroom blocks for deprived schools in the municipality. Notable among them is a 3-unit classroom block at Sromani Presby Primary school”, he noted. \nThis is to complement an existing HIPC funded 3-unit classroom block constructed during former President Kuffour’s reign. \nHe said another classroom block is under construction to replace the wooden structure for the Pre-school division of Sromani Presby Primary school. \nThe Municipal Chief Executive said the assembly is committed to raising the standard of education within the Doramaa area. \nMr. Asubonteng however noted that their greatest challenge is reviving projects that have been abandoned over the years which include a 2-storey 12-unit classroom block at Salvation Army Senior High School at Aboabo near Dormaa Ahenkro. \nSource: Pat Aboagyewaa  ",

      "text": "Inside Africa NEPAD Debate: Zambia Touches On Africa’s Development Zambia highlights key essentials to Africa’s development Zambia made the remarks at the just-concluded Africa-week joint debate on New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), focusing on the progress in implementation and international support as well as on the decade to roll back malaria in developing countries, particularly in Africa Oct 21, 2016 \nZambia says sustainable trade, infrastructure development, gender equality and empowerment, peace, health and education are among key prerequisites to the development of Africa. NEPAD \nZambia made the remarks at the just-concluded Africa-week joint debate on New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), focusing on the progress in implementation and international support as well as on the decade to roll back malaria in developing countries, particularly in Africa. \nMinistry of Foreign Affairs Assistant Director (International Organisations), Mr. Eliphas Chinyonga said Zambia welcomed the programme for infrastructure development in Africa that NEPAD developed, focusing on transformative regional projects. \n“Out of the priority Regional Infrastructure projects identified, Zambia is likely to benefit directly from those that are located or pass through the borders. These include Serenje–Nakonde Road with the total length of 614.71km; Lusaka-Lilongwe ICT Terrestrial Fiber Optic; Zambia-Tanzania-Kenya Transmission Line; and Batoka Gorge Hydro Power Project,” said Mr. Chinyonga at the UN General Assembly meeting. “I am pleased to report that Zambia developed a compendium of climate oriented agriculture technologies in all three of its agro ecological regions. This was facilitated through the support from the NEPAD Climate Change Fund for mainstreaming Climate Smart Agriculture into the National Agriculture Investment Plan.” \nHe said Zambia is committed to promoting human capital development. \nI am pleased to report that Zambia developed a compendium of climate oriented agriculture technologies in all three of its agro ecological regions \nIn this regard, Mr. Chinyonga said Zambia will continue to improve the teaching of science and mathematics, which are critical to attaining improvements in technology and innovation for enhanced industrialisation and job creation. \nMr. Chinyonga also said Zambia was focusing on reducing malaria related deaths countrywide and hoped to achieve a malaria-free Zambia by 2020. \nMr. Chinyonga said, so far, malaria prevalence and deaths have steadily decreased, culminating in an impressive 55 percent reduction in all cases of child mortality. \nOn gender equality and women empowerment, Mr. Chinyonga informed the global body that Zambia enacted the Gender Equity and Equality Act No. 22 of 2015, which has fully domesticated major international and regional instruments including the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa and the SADC Protocol on Gender and Development. \nHowever, Mr. Chinyonga expressed Zambia’s concern that the process of integrating NEPAD into the African Union structures and processes has been slow, despite the African Union Commission and the NEPAD Agency working towards concluding the matter. \n“It is our view that international support to facilitate the inclusion of realistic timelines for concluding the matter would be useful,” said Mr. Chinyonga. “Notwithstanding the foregoing, Zambia still remains fully committed to ensuring that the priority areas of energy, industrialisation, intra-regional trade, food security, health, education, gender equality and adaptation to climate change are fast tracked under NEPAD.” \nSource: NewsGhana.com.gh Do you have more to share about this story - photos or video etc - you can send them to: (newsghana101@gmail.com) TAGS",

Despite its obligations under international law and repeated agreements between the Government of the Republic of South Sudan and the Government of Sudan to end such support, credible reports continue to indicate the Government of the Republic of South Sudan is harboring and providing assistance to armed Sudanese opposition groups. We urge South Sudan’s leaders to redouble their efforts to meet the commitments they recently reached with Sudan under which both sides agreed to end support for armed opposition groups on either side. \nWe also urge both Sudan and South Sudan to fully respect the 2012 Agreement on Security Arrangements \nThe presence of Sudanese armed opposition forces in South Sudan, and their involvement in South Sudan’s internal conflicts, destabilizes both Sudan and South Sudan. It is, moreover, a violation of the terms of the Agreement for the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan. We call on the Government of the Republic of South Sudan to ensure Sudanese armed opposition groups are not in a position to conduct armed operations within South Sudan or across the border in Sudan. \nWe also urge both Sudan and South Sudan to fully respect the 2012 Agreement on Security Arrangements, and withdraw their armed forces from the Safe Demilitarized Border Zone. \n ",

      "text": "Disqualified Ayariga Called Ec Boss A ‘Liar’ Oct 21, 2016 tweet \nDisqualified Presidential Nominee of the All People’s Congress (APC) Hassan Ayariga has chided the Chairperson of the Electoral Commission Charlotte Osei describing the EC boss as a liar. According to the leader and founder of All People’s Congress, the EC boss has lied about his (Hassan Ayariga’s) qualification and threatened to expose the EC boss. \n“I am a statesman, I contested elections in this country and if she doesn’t know she should find out. I will call an International body to expose her for all that she is. She lied about people’s Identity and their qualifications” \nThe Electoral Commission has reported Hassan Ayariga to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) over alleged criminalities he is said to have committed. One of such criminalities has to do with a doctorate degree Hassan Ayariga stated on his presidential nomination form, as being obtained from Great Achievers University of Spain in 2014. But according to the Electoral Commission, checks have revealed that there is no such institution called Great Achievers University in Spain that awards PhD in political science, but rather there is Great Achievers International Theological Seminary which has nothing to do with political science. But Hassan Ayariga insisted that all information provided on his nomination form were accurate and verifiable. He told Bright Kwesi Asempa the host of Onua Fm morning Show ‘Ye Sempa’ that “I have my degree from Great Achievers University, will I award myself a degree, who say I need a degree to become president. It was because there was not enough space of the form given me by EC that was why I shortened the name of the School, EC should have provided more space, how does that become my fault” NO EXPERIENCE Hassan Ayariga also described the chairperson of the Electoral Commission Charlotte Osei as inexperience, wondering why the President before appointing her did not find it expedient to have Dr Kwadwo Afari-Gyan, the former EC boss to disciple her. “What was her performance at her former post the NCCE. If she had done a good job there, she would have known that I contested in the 2012 elections and also there would not be huge number of spoilt ballot papers” He reiterated that if the present EC boss is as qualified as people think, she would not disqualify smaller parties and protect the bigger parties. “Did she find out how many offices both CPP and Independent candidate Jacob Osei Yeboah have across the country, yet she shepherded them” By Bright dzakah/NewsGhana.com.gh Do you have more to share about this story - photos or video etc - you can send them to: (newsghana101@gmail.com) TAGS",

      "text": "Losing Aquatic Matter Through Sand Winning in Coastal Areas ‘Winning The Sand And Losing Fisheries’-A Growing Coastal Belt Problem In Ghana Oct 21, 2016 tweet \nFor decades sand wining and gravel extraction have become prevalent along the coast, where fishing is predominant. The combined effect of the sand winning and stone extraction is resulting in the degradation of vast farmlands and accordingly putting pressure on poor rural farmers who are already vulnerable. \nEventually the practice results in floods, and destruction of turtles’ nestling grounds which is unfriendly to fishing and tourism, together with destruction of landing bases thereby reducing communities’ economic avenues and district assemblies’ revenue potential and ecosystem along the river banks. \nAs a result, the depth of rivers or sea reduce(s) drastically over the years due to silt which has incapacitated its water holding ability. Fisherfolks have complained about the problem, which affect their livelihoods. \nInteracting with some fish processors at Kokrobite revealed that the problem persists and getting out of hand. Many of them have complained to the appropriate authority at the local level, via the district assembly but measures adopted by the assembly seem not solve the address. \nThe perpetrators of the act according to the women, usually do this at night when no one is available to guard the sea or even see them. Some of the women says many of them have tripped as a result of the act sustaining various injuries. In addition, the women complained about the disappearance of sea turtles, which they linked to the activities of sand winning. A District President for the National Fish Processors and Traders Association (NAFPTA), Grace Bondzie says sand winning has come down drastically, adding, these days it is hard to find people doing that. \n“We did campaign on sand winning by informing people if they are seen doing it, they will be arrested by the police and that fear has led to the low patronage. If we can have that on consistent basis it will lead to disappearance of sand winning,” Bondzie states. She laments that another problem confronting the beach is pollution which manifests in the form of plastics, faecal, among others that is posing serious health concern to marine biodiversity. The legal or institutional framework under which sand winning takes place in Ghana and the Ga districts in particular is defined by the following laws–the Minerals and Mining Law PNDCL 153, as amended by Act 475, Small Scale Mining Law PNDCL 218, Sand Winning and Stone Quarrying Bye-Laws and Environmental Assessment Regulations Law LI 1652. Four main organizations, the Minerals Commission, the Mines Department, the Environmental Protection Agency and the District Assemblies are tasked with the enforcement and monitoring of these laws through different roles they play in the districts. \nSand winning or mining will not directly affect fish stock unless it is somehow affecting unique habitat and causing erosion, destruction of mangroves, nursery grounds, and reproduction grounds essential for fish, says Brian Crawford, the Chief of Party of the USAID/Ghana Sustainable Fisheries Management Project (SFMP). \n“One of the biggest problems of sand mining is the increment of coastal erosion that we have seen along Ghana’s coast line, like Ada, Keta, regions and at the mouth of the Volta River where many places along the beach are eroding rather than accruing. \n“Along the coastal belt, a lot of the coastal lines are being lost to shore lines, while at the same time the shore line is retreating inland. In addition, many of the shore line is getting further of the shore,” he states. \nAccording to Crawford, whenever people along the coast engage in sand mining that paves way for sediments to be carried along the shore line through wave action eventually leading to erosion of beaches in the country. \nHe says that even though sand can be carried from places where excess sand abounds, to places which are experiencing deficits that also comes with its associated problems.“When sand budgeting is done to correct the problem of sand mining in an effort to maintain beaches, it also leaves room for less sand at some point which worsen coastal erosion in areas that are already naturally eroding the coast lines. \n“So that is why there is lots of concern that sand mining should be either banned or regulated in a way that is not impacting on coastal erosion particularly in rivers and along the beaches where eroding shore lines are going to be eroding faster which puts public infrastructure at risk, ” Crawford explains. \nWhat happens is that whenever storm waves associated with high tides occurs, that results in significant flooding which brings about loss of lives and property, leading to huge financial burden on individuals, families and the government. \nSo one of the things that the SFMP is doing particularly in the western and central regions is working with town and country planning department to incorporate into their spatial planning elements that look at the unique dynamics of the coastal zone–that these are not stable shorelines, they move, some grow and some gets less over time. \nCrawford points out that it is crucial for any spatial planning being done to take into consideration sediments and public infrastructure, thus areas which records high erosion rates need to be as designated as no build zones to protect lives and property. \n“If you don’t do this what happens is that then government being asked to build costly shoreline protection works by putting up rocks on the shore line or other techniques to stop coastal erosion by spending millions of dollars and even more in terms cedis,” he states. #“These problems are going to get worse in the future because of sea level rise being caused by global warming and as the planet warms up the ocean warms up, and as water warms up, it expands,” Crawford adds. \nThe sea level rise will continue and might even get worse as a result of carbon emission and greenhouses gases, the burning of forests, fossil fuels at levels that are unprecedented in the history of the world. \nThere are a lot of mangrove destruction which people use it for fire wood, and building purposes, which is also a concern. \nMangrove serves as carbon sink to global warming, that is another reason it will be important to maintain mangrove because that helps to sequester carbon in the ground, keep it in the wood and not in the atmosphere and that ultimately help prevent greater global warming. The mangrove are central fish habitat and one thing people often think is they are breeding ground, but the mangrove are generally nursery grounds where a lot of small baby fish reside and provides a lot of protection because of the roots and mangrove provide a lot of food and protection for the juvenile fish. \n“So as they grow up and gets bigger a lot of the juvenile fish that live in the estuaries, lagoons, and rivers around the mangrove areas get bigger. \n“Some of them will stay in the estuary area, while many will then migrate into the ocean. So it is very important that we try to maintain those mangrove because that helps to protect the juvenile fishes for them to grow up and reproduce and provide the next generation,” he adds. Adult sea turtles spend all their lives at sea and come unto shore to lay eggs in the sand along the beaches. \n“So if erosion is occurring and we are losing sandy beaches that are central habitat to maintain sea turtles population then it becomes a problem to sea turtles to lay eggs.“If there are not any sandy beaches that has the characteristics that are needed then they can’t lay their eggs and if they can’t lay their eggs, there is no next generation of sea turtles that we can find in the ocean. Sand wining can also have some significance in their natural habitat or nursing grounds for sea turtles,” Crawford says. \nWomen groups, fishermen can play a role by not engaging in sand winning themselves and if they see that occurring they need to contact local authorities who should be taking enforcement actions against those who are doing it which is probably illegal in the first place.“The question is, do they have permit and if they don’t have permit they shouldn’t be sand winning. If permits are being provided we should make sure that permits are not provided for sand winning in areas where it will increase coastal erosion problems, because you make money from the permits in the short term but then you are going to spend greatly in the long term to protect the shoreline,” he emphasises. \nThe project manager of the DAA, Mr Abraham Asare, says sand winning is one of the biggest problem in most of the landing sites or fishing communities in Ghana. According to him, most of the people in the communities such as Kokrobite fetch the sand to make concrete blocks. \n“In communities where the chiefs and people have ban the practice, you still have people doing this in the night, by fetching with bucket and trucks to make blocks for construction of houses. It is not a good practice, but because they fetch it in bit, they don’t see the effects of it,” said Mr Asare. \nMr Asare states that any sand fetched has an effect on the landing site or beach, where the sea gradually starts eroding and becomes a problem and it is not only in Kokrobite but across all coastal belts of Ghana. \n“The number of blocks that has been manufactured and still packed at the landing beaches, was huge upon a visit to Apam recently. \n“Through interactions with the local people it was revealed that people contract others to fetch the sand for them and lay the blocks right at the landing beaches. I could count about 200,000 sandcrete blocks for buildings packed along the beach in Apam alone. \n“It appears they do not see any problem with what they are doing and I have been told that the chief fishermen have ban such practice but the enforcement is a problem,” he notes. The Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development, Ms Sherry Ayittey, also says local government officials are the ones that give the permit for people to engage in sand winning.“Apart from that it is being done illegally by the fishermen themselves. In the night trucks come and collect the sand. The local government are the ones to implement the buffer policy that says there should be no activity within 50 metres from the water to protect the beach,” the minister notes. \nBy Samuel Hinneh  ",

The panel was moderated by Dr Isaac F. Mensah-Bonsu at the National Development Planning Commission. 
On the topic Urban Development Management in Ghana and Implications for the New Urban Agenda, Mr Adzornu said linkages to the New Urban Agenda (NUA) for Ghana was to review appropriate policies and framework in accordance with NUA and incorporating it into all levels of planning. 
It was also from a partnership especially with the private sector and development partners to ensure efficient service delivery, localise and adopt Sustainable Development Goals and other international frameworks and involve the marginalised in planning especially slum dwellers and disabled. 
Mr Adzornu said the Ministry in working with partners was preparing to review the National Urban Policy and Action Plan and other relevant policy frameworks, Preparation of a Monitoring and Evaluation Plan for the National Urban Policy, Preparation of an Investment Plan for the National Urban Policy and Action Plan and GAP Analysis. 
The Head of the Urban Development Unit said GUMPP was a 44.5million Euros Government – AFD Urban Development programme and targets four selected cities including Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi, Tamale and Ho as its pilot stage, seeking to promote a comprehensive/city-wide approach to urban issues, within the framework of the draft National Urban Policy (NUP) and its action plan. 
Mr Adzornu said the objectives of the GUMPP was to implement urban development programme in four secondary cities allowing for a widespread access to essential services at the desired level and quality and to build the financial, management and ownership capacities of the four selected Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs). 
“It is also to support economic activities and enhance the revenue collection capacity of local governments for increased local internally generated funds and strengthen MMDA’s urban planning capacities, thus limiting the negative impact of urban sprawl on peripheral eco-systems.” 
Mr Adzornu called on the international community for partnership in knowledge exchange and also identify Housing Development, Local Governance Framework, Fiscal Decentralisation, Urban Services Provision, Transportation, Urban Development Expansion, Energy, Natural Resource Management, Water and Sanitation Management and Policy Formulation as the potential areas of collaboration and partnerships with other countries.

                            [text] => Trouble For Mahama Over Harry Anthony Attipoe … As La Youth Threaten To Vote Against Him If Attipoe Still Stays As GARHC Registrar Oct 20, 2016 tweet 
Coalition of Ga-Dangme Youth has demonstrated through the principal streets of Labadi a suburb of Accra in protest against the entrenched position taken by the transferred Registrar of the Greater Accra Regional House of Chiefs (GARHC), Harry Anthony Attipoe not to respect the transfer order. 
The youth have thus launched their anger at government for not impressing upon the Regional House of Chief to enforce the transfer arrangement and thus allowing Harry Anthony Attipoe to continue in office. 
The youth in their demonstration warned government to ensure that Attipoe leave or incur the wrath of the people on December 7. 
They threaten to vote against the ND and John Mahama if government seats aloft and see Attipoe violates the transfer instruction with impunity. Bearing placards some of which read, “No Transfer, No Vote,” “We Want Attipoe Out,” “Attipoe Stop The Thievery, Leave GA,” “Council Of State Member, Adei Annang, Stay Off Attipoe’s Transfer,” 
“Ndc’S Operation 1.5 million Votes In GA Will Not Materialize If Attipoe Continue To Stay,” the youth accused some government officials of taking interest in the transfer of Attipoe hence their unwillingness to ensure that the proper things are done. 
Harry Anthony Attipoe was transferred per a posting instruction letter dated March 11, 2016 and the office of the President letter dated May 23, 2016. 
According to the posting instruction letter Harry Anthony Attipoe is to go to the Volta Regional House of Chiefs to serve as the Registrar and will take over from Mr. Daniel A. Azah, whilst Emmanuel Addoquaye who was serving at the Central Regional House of Chiefs as Assistant Registrar will take over from Attipoe at the Greater Regional House of Chiefs. 
However, he has refused to leave post. This development however generated series of petitions from La youth groups and some chiefs within the Region who are calling on him to leave so as to enable the incoming Registrar, Emmanuel Tetteh Addoquaye to take over. 
However, a letter from the Ministry of Chieftaincy And Traditional Affairs dated August 12, 2016 after it received series of petition in that regard, the Minister ordered Harry Anthony Attipoe to leave post since his posting to the Volta Region “Still stands.” 
“… You are therefore instructed to write a comprehensive handing-over notes and hand over to Mr Emmanuel Tetteh Addoquaye, Assistant National Registrar by Thursday, 18th August 2016.,” the Minister stated in that letter which wassigned on his behalf by B. A. Adotey, Director PPME/HRM. 
The said letter also made it clear that, Attipoe’s failure to proceed on his posting to the Volta Regional House of Chiefs will mean vacation of post. 
Meanwhile, the youth are aggrieved at the continue stay of Atttipoe at the GARHC three months on, refusing to go. 
The angry youth pointed out that they have decided to embark on demonstration because despite several letters affirming the registrars transfer by his sector Minister, the registrar, Harry Anthony Attipoe continues to disrespect his orders. 
According to the Ga-Dangme Youth the situation is creating tension within the Ga Dangme area as the youth in the region are unhappy with the development. 
They accused Harry Anthony Attipoe of trying to hijack the Greater Accra Regional House of Chiefs with his actions.

                            [title] => Nyankpala: Cowpea farmers lament continuous lost in yield
                            [text] => News Nyankpala: Cowpea farmers lament continuous lost in yield Cowpea farmers in the Savannah Ecological Zone of Ghana have expressed concern over the continuous loss of more than 80 per cent of their crop yields annually to the destruction by the ‘Pod-borer’, insect. Oct 20, 2016 tweet 
The farmers, including those from the Upper East, Upper West, Northern, Volta and Brong Ahafo Regions, have appealed to the government consider supplying them with improved cowpea seed varieties that could withstand the insects. 
The farmers expressed the concern at Nyankpala in the Tolon District at a day’s sensitisation seminar organised by the West Africa office of the African Agricultural Technology Foundation, in collaboration with the Savannah Agricultural Research Institute and the Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology-Ghana. 
The seminar was aimed at sensitising the participants on the prospects and benefits of the Pod-borer Resistant Cowpea, and to also create awareness on agricultural biotechnology and its benefits. 
It was attended by farmers, seed companies, chiefs, regulators, students, agricultural extension officers, agro-dealers and scientists. 
It was also intended to solicit the support of farmers for the adoption of new varieties of cowpea seeds, showcase the Confined Field Trial site to stakeholders, as well as acquaint participants with the new variety of cowpea seeds. 
Mr James Ayamba Anaaba, a chief and farmer from Narango in the Binduri District of the Upper East Region, said he had been cultivating cowpea for more than 26 years and used to grow 100 acres every year, “unfortunately, in 2015 and this year, 2016, I grew only two acres, because the losses are too much to bear”. 
He said as a result of the situation, his expenditure had risen and at the end of the season some of his properties including animals were sold to be able to repay the bank loan. 
Mr Anaaba, who gave out a portion of his land for the demonstration of the Pod-borer resistant cowpea in his district, said there was a vast difference between the new improved cowpea and the existing ones. 
He appealed to government to support the initiative by the scientists, so that they can produce more seeds for supply to farmers. 
Mr Mahama Lansah, a farmer from Damongo in the West Gonja District of the Northern Region, said “after 22 years of work as a cowpea farmer, I have nothing to show, because of the attack by pod-borers”.

                            [text] => The school at Bormase Siblinor in News  50 am / 
Until funds are released by the government through the Ghana Education Trust Fund (GETFund) or help comes from elsewhere, school children in Bormase-Siblinor in the Upper Manya Krobo District of the Eastern Region, will continue to study in an uncompleted building and under trees, at the mercy of the rains. 
They may, perhaps, have to revisit their former days of journeying for two hours to the next town, Sekesua, to attend school again. 
This is because work on a four-unit GETFund classroom project which started in 2012, and was expected to be completed within 12 months, has come to a standstill as the contractor has abandoned the project due to the lack of funds. 
The school children are in competition with snakes, goats and fowls for space in the structure. 
Additionally, the children face health risks from animal droppings and the scorching sun, making the environment not conducive for effective and efficient teaching and learning. 
The contractor, Mr. Sogbor, confirmed that lack of funds had stalled the project. 
He said he started the project with his own resource four years ago, but had not been reimbursed for work done so far. 
Mr. Sogbor said work on the project had progressed and what was left was roofing, plastering, flooring of the classrooms, fixing of windows and doors and painting. 
The teachers and pupils have no option than to occupy the uncompleted building for classes which were often disrupted anytime it rained or threatened to rain. 
Those who are unable to get space in the uncompleted building are compelled to learn under trees on the compound. 
Studying under the trees became the only option since the temporary structures built by a concerned citizen Mrs. Mary Ayongo Agbettor in 2006, with bamboo sticks and mud, had collapsed. 
Mrs. Agbettor privately established the school for the community and paid the salaries of teachers from her own resources. 
That had greatly helped the school children who previously, had to trek two hours to the nearby school at Sekesua. 
The government however took over the school in 2012 and initiated the four unit classroom block and a headmaster’s office with funding from GETFund. 
Due to the nature of the structure, parents now prefer their wards to stay at home until they have turned nine and are capable of undertaking the two hour journey to Sekesua. 
A parent who shared the community’s frustration to The Ghanaian Times, said “The children are very young, so sometimes it takes them more than two hours to reach school due to the long distance to the nearby village. Sometimes, when they get exhausted, they rest under trees before continuing their journey. That is why they normally start school at age nine”. 
In many urban areas and cities in Ghana, children are sent to school at an early age. This means that by the time they are five or six years, they are already in Class One. The situation seems to be very different in Bormase-Siblinor, a community of predominantly poor peasant farmers.

                            [text] => UNESCO calls for promotion of STEM education in News  48 am / 
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) has urged African countries to promote Science, Technical, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education to speed up the continent’s socio-economic development. 
Mr. Tirso Dos Santos, the UNESCO Country Representative in Ghana, said the organisation, being the only specialised UN agency with science as one of its core mandates, realises that promoting STEM and Innovation would require cooperation at various levels. 
“We therefore encourage and pursue sub-regional, regional, south-south and north-south collaboration in order to solve pressing developmental challenges,” Mr. Santos stated in Accra at a Regional Consultative Workshop on Strengthening Cooperation in STEM Education in West Africa. 
The two-day workshop was organised by UNESCO in collaboration with the Directorate of Technical Cooperation in Africa (DTCA) under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Nigeria and the Ecowas Parliament. 
It was attended by 35 participants from seven out of the eight countries covered by the UNESCO Multisectoral Office in Abuja. 
The participating countries include Ghana, Nigeria, Benin, Cote d’Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, and Togo. 
Mr. Santos said most countries in West Africa might struggle to attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) unless there was substantial investment in science education, promotion of scientific research, cooperation in education and development of human resource capital in the region. 
“Indeed, in formulating the agenda 2030, science cuts across almost all of the 17 SDGs. 
“Science has therefore, been recognised as being critical to meeting the challenge of sustainable development,” he said. 
He explained that science was universal and cut across cultural and political borders, stating that “this is in no way to say that humanities or the arts are less important than the sciences”. 
“The point here is that we all need to recognise what science could give to society and to harness that for our own good,” he said. 
He said STEM education and capacity building should be promoted in low and middle income countries, particularly in cases where a widespread appreciation of the benefits and the resources for STEM education were lacking. 
Mr. Santos said: “To reduce the dependence on industrialised nations, we need to be scientifically literate.” 
Mr. Mahama Ayariga, Ghana’s Minister of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation, in a speech read on his behalf by Mr. John K. Arthur, a Director at the Ministry, said “although STEM education has become a priority in most parts of the world, sadly we cannot say the same for our sub-region”. 
He said in Ghana’s case, a report by the National Council for Tertiary Education showed that only 39 per cent of the 127,502 students who were admitted to the eight public universities in the 2012/2013 academic year were admitted to science-related programmes. 
He said this percentage was below the target of 60 per cent enrolment in science and technology-related disciplines for all universities in Ghana mentioned in the 2010-2020 Education Strategic Plan of the Ministry of Education. 
He said Ghana had plans and policies in place to ensure that STEM education was supported, adding: however, the sad trend observed is that more and more students are fleeing from the study of science.” 
Hajia Khadija Bukar A. Ibrahim, Nigeria’s Minister of State, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Chairperson Presidential Inter-Ministerial Committee on the DTCA, in a speech read on her behalf, said STEM education was essential for accelerating the West Africa sub-region’s growth and development. 
Mr. Mohammed Kachallah, Acting Director General, DTCA, Nigeria Ministry of Foreign Affairs, gave an overview on “The Role of Secondary Education in Regional Integration and Development”. 
He said there was an urgent need for the realignment of the curriculum as well as emphasises on the need to strengthen the teaching of STEM education in Africa. 
Dr. Nelson Magbagbeola, Secretary General, ECOWAS Parliament, said in order to ensure a vibrant technology platform through STEM education, ECOWAS member-states must enthrone and sustain a culture of innovation and strengthen intellectual property systems.

                            [text] => Give back to your schools —-Old students challenged in Education  45 am / 
Old students must build a culture of relationship with their institutions to support and enhance the institution’s ability to train and educate new students. 
According to Joe K. Mensah, Vice President and Country Manager, Kosmos Energy, such a relationship was necessary to encourage the act of giving back by individuals to their alma maters to promote quality education. 
Mr. Mensah made these remarks at the 1 st graduation and 4 th matriculation ceremony of Palm Institute of Strategic Leadership in Accra. 
The event saw 19 students graduate with diploma in Business Administration, Banking Technology and Accounting and Computerised Accounting while 18 students were matriculated. 
Mr. Mensah urged the graduands to strive to become agents of change with a commitment to affect the lives of people in their societies and advised them to remain tenacious in the face of challenges that would arise in their determination to achieve their aims. 
Mr. Mensah asked them to guard against ‘anxiety after school’ that could distort their determination to succeed. 
Delivering on the state of the institute, Peter Carlos Okantey, Founder, said the institute had received the approval to run two more diploma programmes, Agribusiness and Finance and Procurement and Materials Management, in addition to the three diploma programmes currently run by the school. 
He said the institute was focused on training students strategically for the Ghanaian and African industries. 
Ms. Linda Bortey, in her valedictory message expressed gratitude to the management for dedicating their time and other resources to tutor them and helping them to acquire the requisite skill to better their lives. 
She pledged the graduands determination to be worthy ambassadors of the institute and use their potentials to contribute positively to the development of the country.

                            [text] => IPMC graduands urged to provide technological solutions in Education  43 am / 
IPMC College of Technology yesterday held its 9 th graduation ceremony with a call on graduands to support society with their technological skills and know-how in addressing problems. 
The event, on the theme “Technology- the world’s new axis”, saw 557 students graduate with diploma certificates in hardware engineering, software engineering, database technology and graphic design. 
Technology Expo, which forms part of the ceremony, also offered students of the college the platform to exhibit their accomplished works in technology. 
In a message to the graduands, Farouk Omar, Chief Information Officer, GCB Bank, asked them to take advantage of the advancement in technology around the globe to offer digital solutions, which could grow into business ventures. 
He urged them to collaborate, if possible, to be able to transform innovations into profitable businesses. 
“It pays to put new ideas together rather than an individual trying to pursue it alone. Be a team player, tolerate the opinions of others and be ready to listen at all times. These will yield money in the long term,” he said. 
Discipline, hard work and dedication, he noted, was essential in realising their potentials in established ventures and urged them to remain committed to these qualities for the betterment of their lives. 
“You are the architect of your professional career. Actions and attitudes that propel its jeopardy must be abolished from this moment”, he said. 
Mr. Omar explained that dreams and objectives, although difficult to achieve, must be chased despite the challenges. 
Amar Deep Singh Hari, Chief Executive Officer, IPMC Ghana Limited, said the college was focused on training and equipping students with the necessary skills that would help them build their own careers. 
The college, he noted was also on the verge of partnering with other institutions to be able to offer diverse technological training to make them ready for the job market.

                            [text] => CADFUND donates to Odorgonno Basic Model Sch in Education  40 am / 
The China Africa Development Fund (CADFUND) has donated educational and sports equipment worth GH₵ 8,000 to Odorgonno Model Basic School. 
The items include story books, pencils, erasers, toys, footballs, basketballs and buckets of oil paint. 
Presenting them, the Vice President of CADFUND, Mr. Zhou Chao said the donation was to support the school to provide quality education to the students. 
According to him, as developing countries, China and Ghana were faced with the task of developing domestic economy and improving the standard of living of people especially through education. 
He said that China had learned that education played an important role in the socio-economic development of a country hence his organisation’s focus on supporting educational institutes. 
“A country’s hope lies in children and children’s hope lies in education,” he said. 
Receiving the items, Mrs. Victoria Gyatsen, headmistress of the school said that CADFUND had supported the school since its establishment in 2009. 
According to her, support from the organisation had contributed in the success story of pupils from the school emerging as champions in the boys’ football competition and girls’ netball competition in the Ga Central Municipality. 
She thanked the organisation for the gesture and cited the lack of furniture and books for the school’s library as a challenge facing the school and appealed for help from other corporate bodies.

The Vice President, Kwesi Amissah-Arthur says a vote for any party other than the ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC) in the December election, will amount to a wasted vote. 
According to the Vice President the government has performed creditably to justify another term. 
“Evidence of our good performance abounds for all Ghanaians to see,” he said, and expressed confidence that the electorate would renew the mandate of the NDC administration. 
Vice President Amissah-Arthur said this at a mammoth rally at Diaso in the Upper Denkyira West District of the Central Region yesterday, as part of his campaign tour of the region. 
“The NDC is development-oriented and we will work to achieve more progress for the country in the second term. 
We do not offer false promises as others are doing to deceive Ghanaians. We deliver on our promises,” he said. 
Citing various completed projects in the district, including schools, roads, markets and water facilities, the Vice President said only a good and focused government could deliver such projects to better the lot of the people. 
He thanked the chiefs and people of the district for their support and urged them to be vigilant against deceitful propaganda by the opposition parties. 
“You vote for development and progress when you vote for the NDC,” he said. 
He gave the assurance that more projects and development interventions would be advanced to the area in line with the government’s policy of equitable distribution of national resources. 
From Diaso, Vice President Amissah-Arthur moved to Ayamfuri where he was mobbed by a large crowd of NDC supporters who chanted party slogans. 
He urged them to vote massively for President Mahama and the presidential candidate for the area to continue the good works. 
Samuel Ofosu Ampofo, a National Vice Chairman of the NDC urged the people to express appreciation for the rapid development and high number of projects undertaken for the area by voting massively for the NDC.

                            [text] => Police van rams anti-US protesters in Foreign News  35 am / 
A police van has rammed into protesters in the Philippines capital Manila as a demonstration outside the US embassy turned violent. 
Footage showed protesters surrounding the van and hitting it with batons taken from police. The vehicle then drives into the crowd several times, injuring a number of people. 
Hundreds had met to demand the US end its military presence in the country. 
President Rodrigo Duterte has queried long-standing ties with the US. 
Police arrested at least 23 people, who threw red paint at them and a member of the US forces at the embassy. 
Tear gas was used against the demonstrators, after they broke through a line of riot police. They also took control of the water hose of a fire truck being used to douse them and threw stones at police. 
It remains unclear how many people were injured by the police van and how serious their injuries are. 
Television footage of the incident shows the van driving into people at speed. At one point it knocks over a woman and drags her body along the road. The van brakes and she appears to scramble away. 
Renato Reyes of the left-wing activist group Bayan said at least three people were taken to hospital after being rammed by the van. 
“Even as the president avowed an independent foreign policy, Philippines police forces still act as running dogs of the US,” he said, adding there was “no justification” for the police violence. 
A spokesperson for the US embassy told the BBC it had “seen reports” of injuries, but declined to comment further, directing inquiries to police. 
President Duterte is in Beijing, seeking to deepen ties and economic relations with China. Bilateral relations were strained under his predecessor over acrimonious territorial disputes in the South China Sea. 
Relations with the US, a longstanding ally, have deteriorated in recent months over Mr. Duterte’s controversial war on drugs.

                            [text] => Safeguard the peace – NCCE in Politics  34 am / 
The National Commission on Civic Education (NCCE) has called on Ghanaians to avoid acts that will disturb the peace before, during and after the December polls. 
The South Tongu District Director of the NCCE, Oral-Robert Amenyo, gave the advice at a community durbar at Vume in the South Tongu District of the Volta Region. 
It was to sensitise residents on political tolerance and the need to safeguard the peace they are currently enjoying. 
The forum also educated the people on the contents of the code of conduct for political parties. 
The durbar is part of the ongoing community engagement organised by the Inter-party Dialogue Committee (IPDC) with support from the South Tongu District Assembly. 
The South Tongu District Police Commander, Superintendent of Police, Anthony Aduhene assured the electorate that the elections taskforce in the district has put in place adequate security measures to protect the peace at all the potential flashpoints in the district. 
He further expatiated on few of the electoral offences and warned the youths not to allow themselves to be manipulated by politicians. 
Togbe Adzrawusu II, who is the vice chairman of the IPDC and the Presiding Member of the South Tongu District Assembly chaired the function and advised Ghanaians to live in peace.

                            [text] => Somali militants attack strategic town in African News  33 am / 
There has been fierce fighting near the Somali capital, Mogadishu, after fighters from the Islamist militant group al-Shabab overran a key town. Reports say at least four policemen and several civilians were killed when militants stormed Afgoye on Tuesday. A spokesman with the African Union mission to Somalia later said the gunmen had been forced out, but this was not confirmed. Witnesses said gunshots could still be heard into the night. The African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) is supporting the Somali government in its fight against al-Shabab. Residents said the attack on Afgoye, 30km (18 miles) from Mogadishu, started when militants detonated a car bomb outside a police post, killing four policemen. People took cover in their homes as fighters appeared in parts of the town and clashed with Somali troops and African Union forces. Police officer Abdukadir Ahmed told AFP news agency that at least 10 people, including civilians, had been killed as well as some of the attackers. Afgoye is considered a strategic town as it sits on one of only two roads into the capital. As the fighting raged, both sides said they had control of the town. AMISOM troops captured Afgoye town in 2012.

                            [text] => Schools urged to involve parents in choosing schools for wards Involve parents in choosing schools and programmes for pupils-GES PRO Oct 20, 2016 tweet 
Mr. Anthony Kwaku Amoah, a Public Relations Officer of Ghana Education Service (GES), has urged schools to involve parents in choosing senior high, technical and vocational schools for children. 
Speaking at a special career guidance session titled, “Knowing Your Personality for a Good Career” for some 100 pupils of Rachel Shiloh Schools Complex, a private basic school in Accra, Mr. Anthony Amoah expressed regret at the way the supposedly interesting exercise of having to place successful candidates of the Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE) into senior high schools has become an event for weeping and mourning by pupils and some parents in recent times. 
According to him, until schools fully involve parents in helping pupils to choose their preferred schools and programmes of study, the situation where some parents reject schools and programmes of their wards would continue, adding, “Parents are the major beneficiaries of successful children and so the need to involve them in every stage of child education and training, including choice of schools and programmes of study”. 
“Let me use this time to advise teachers and pupils against the tendency of choosing schools and programmes for pupils without the pupils themselves and parents knowing what exactly happen in such schools. Teachers and parents should assist pupils in all areas of education to prevent the discontent and anxiety that most pupils face”, he said. 
Miss Rosemond Nutifafa Adanuti, a teacher and counsellor with GES, urged schools to continue to help pupils identify and develop their talents, skills and potentialities. 
Miss Adanuti advised the participants to learn the good qualities of teachers for better life, adding, “Observe your teachers well and try to emulate their positive lifestyles. Teachers are role models so listen to them and respect them for your own good in future”. 
Mrs. Rachel Shiloh, the proprietress of the school, said that her school, which is within its 15 years of its establishment, has produced pupils who are now students in what she described as, “top senior high schools in the country doing very good courses.” 
She said she would always engage the services of professionals and resource persons to contribute to the delivery of quality education service to pupils.

                            [text] => Business Bayport Tanzania celebrates 10th anniversary Bayport Financial Services leading micro-credit service provider in Tanzania celebrates 10 years Having started its first operations in Zambia in 2001, the Bayport Group operations are currently in 7 African countries and 2 in Latin America Oct 20, 2016 tweet 
Tanzania’s leading specialist credit provider, Bayport Financial Services (www.BayportFinance.com), has over the last 10 years contributed significantly to improving the lives of thousands of Tanzanians through the provision of credit. 
Bayport Tanzania is among ten subsidiaries of the Bayport Group that provides financial solutions to formally and informally employed individuals in emerging markets. The group’s services promote financial inclusion for people who are unable to access traditional banking services or the under-banked. Having started its first operations in Zambia in 2001, the Bayport Group operations are currently in 7 African countries and 2 in Latin America. These countries are Zambia, Uganda, Ghana, Tanzania, Botswana, South Africa, Mozambique, Colombia, and Mexico. 
Today Bayport Group has a loyal customer base of approximately 518 000 customers who regularly and repeatedly access its services. 
According to Bayport Tanzania Chief Executive Officer John Mbaga, Bayport disbursed over Tshs 48 billion during the 2015 financial year alone. Bayport is considered one of the ‘large tax payers’ in Tanzania, paying over Tsh 7 billion to the fiscus in 2014. 
“Our desire is to improve the lives of our customers and give them opportunities that will benefit not just them but their children and future generations,” said Mbaga at a media event recently. “We support them by focusing on short-term cash flow relief, which in turn helps families towards increasing and lasting financial wellness.” 
Bayport Tanzania was incorporated in 2006. It rapidly became the leading unsecured credit provider to employees in both the public and private sectors. Bayport’s footprint of 83 permanent and 45 mobile branches reaches every region in mainland Tanzania. 
The company has 300 permanent employees and a network of more than 1 000 sales agents. 
“The jobs we provide have contributed to the reduction of youth unemployment in the country,” said Mbaga. 
According to the Integrated Labour Force Survey (ILFS-2014), the unemployment rate in Tanzania stood at 13.70%. 
In addition to unsecured loans, Bayport’s portfolio includes insurance products such as the Education Protection Policy that covers dependents’ education fees for up to three years in the event of the policy holder’s death. Bayport’s Credit Life policy covers outstanding loan balances should customers be retrenched, become disabled, pass away or contract a dread disease such as cancer. 
Bayport recently launched mortgage-type loans that allow customers to own a surveyed plot of land. The product extends Bayport loans to off-payroll borrowers by using the surveyed plot of land as collateral. 
The jobs we provide have contributed to the reduction of youth unemployment in the country 
Commenting on Bayport’s corporate social responsibility policy, Mbaga said that education is its priority. “Through our ‘Change a Life’ initiative we have been refurbishing classrooms in various schools, donating desks, providing full scholarships for university students and donating books. Since 2006, we have had a direct impact on 1 500 primary and secondary school students.” 
Bayport also supports orphaned children. A flagship project is the EOTF-sponsored orphanage whose kindergarten Bayport has upgraded to modern standards. The company’s TSh 200- million investment has resulted in an eco-friendly facility with natural lighting and natural ventilation that caters for 40 children at the EOTF center and 60 more from the neighboring villages. 
Reflecting on Bayport’s 10-year journey of business accomplishments in the country, Mbaga said that the company is proud of the growth and maturity it has achieved over the past decade. “We celebrate the opportunity and the ability to impact the lives of our customers, stakeholders, employees and the communities in which we operate.” 
He noted that the company’s strategic vision and on-the-ground implementation had found favour with investors, among them Swedish investment company AB Kinnevik. In July 2010 the latter invested US$40 million in the Bayport Group to become the single largest institutional shareholder in the company. 
Four months later, Bayport issued its maiden bond in the international debt capital markets, raising a total of US$100 million. 
“In 2016, Bayport Management Ltd closed a $250 million senior debt facility with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), the US government’s development finance institution. The long-term loan will support the group’s financial inclusion and growth agenda across its operations. As a Bayport subsidiary, Bayport Tanzania contributes to the group’s investment profile, and benefits from it,” said Mbaga. 
Bayport’s business strategy, according to Mbaga, is based on product diversification and technological innovation with people as the core focus. 
In step with the group strategy, Bayport Tanzania re-branded its identity in 2015 with a people-centered message, giving the company the opportunity to reposition itself as a financial solutions provider. 
“Our new brand was not developed in isolation. It grew out of our business philosophy – which is called The Bayport Way – and supports it,” explained Mbaga. “The Bayport Way is all about how we treat people, be they employees, customers or investors, and how we add value to their lives.“ 
As a group, Bayport believes that credit is a powerful enabler when managed responsibly and rolled out effectively. “It never fails to inspire us when we see how our customers put their credit to positive use and drive economic activity that fundamentally improves their lives,” said Mbaga. 
The CEO thanked Bayport Tanzania’s customers, funders, the government and other stakeholders for the unwavering support that they have given the company over the past 10 years. 
“It has been an exciting journey filled with achievements. Without all our stakeholders, we would not have achieved these great milestones. I assure you that Bayport Tanzania is growing stronger every year. As we march into the next decade, we are determined and committed to achieve even higher standards of excellence in providing our unmatched products and services in Tanzania.”

                            [text] => Headlines EC conducts balloting for parliamentary candidates The Electoral Commission (EC) ,on Thursday, conducted balloting for parliamentary candidates of the 15 participating political parties, with barely 48 days to the December 7 Polls, . Oct 20, 2016 tweet 
Seven of the parties were represented at the EC’s Head Office in Accra for the balloting. These are the National Democratic Congress (NDC), New Patriotic Party (NPP), Progressive People’s Party (PPP), National Democratic Party (NDP), Independent People’s Party (IPP), Great Consolidated Popular Party (GCPP) and the United People’s Party (UPP). 
The GCPP placed first, followed by the PPP, NDC, UPP and the NPP. The NDP placed sixth followed by the IPP at the close of the balloting for placement on the ballot paper for the election 2016. 
The rest of the political parties, which were not present at the event, had their positions determined by the manner in which their presidential candidates filed their nomination papers. 
They are the United Front Party (UFP) which placed eighth followed by the All People’s Congress (APC), Reformed Patriotic Democrat (RPD), United Development System Party (UDSP), Ghana Freedom Party (GFP), Convention People’s Party (CPP), People’s National Convention (PNC) and the Democratic People’s Party (DPP) placing 15th. 
Mr Samuel Tettey, the EC Director for Elections, explained that the contest for the positions for the independent candidates would be held throughout the 275 constituencies. 
On the issue that in the past, presidential and parliamentary candidates usually occupied the same position on the ballot paper, Mr Tettey said, it was a convention that the EC usually used in the past, but it was not backed by any law. 
Mr Amadu Sulley, the EC Deputy Commissioner in-charge of Elections, said balloting for positions on the presidential ballot paper had been suspended pending the outcome of legal suits filed against the EC by some presidential aspirants who had been disqualified by the Commission. 
He said due to the limited amount of time left, the EC would go ahead with the printing of the ballot papers and notice of polls for the parliamentary candidates. 
He announced that the Inter-Party Advisory Committee (IPAC) would hold its next meeting on Friday, October 28, to deliberate issues pertaining to the December 7 general election. 
Mrs Charlotte Osei, the Chairperson of the EC, sat through the session.. 
Mr Johnson Asiedu Nketiah, the General Secretary of the NDC, in an interview with the Ghana News Agency, said the number ‘three’ was significant in the divine realm; declaring that it was in line with John 3:16 in the Bible. 
Mr John Boadu, the NPP’s National Organiser, and Acting General Secretary, expressed concern over the different placement of presidential and parliamentary candidates on the ballot paper and its impact on the elections. 
He, however, said he was hopeful that voters would be able distinguish his party’s logo and the pictures attached to the elephant from other political parties.

                            [title] => 100,000 Burundian refugees already back home
                            [text] => Inside Africa 100,000 Burundian refugees already back home At least 100,000 Burundian refugees who had fled the country's 2015 crisis have already returned home, the Burundian home affairs minister said Wednesday on the sidelines of a meeting with leaders of political parties. Oct 20, 2016 tweet 
“By now, more than 100,000 Burundian refugees who had fled the crisis in April 2015 have already returned to their villages. Most of them were in Tanzanian and in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo),” said Burundian Home Affairs and Civic Education Minister Pascal Barandagiye. 
According to him, many Burundian refugees have been coming back home from Tanzania and the DR Congo that are cooperating well with Burundi in terms of repatriation of those refugees. 
Barandagiye said, “The problem we are facing is Rwanda that does not want to cooperate with us (Burundi) for the repatriation of Burundian refugees living in Rwanda.” 
He added that all mechanisms have been put in place to receive returnees in peace and dignity. 
“We have prepared transit sites that will receive returnees before they reach their home villages,” said Barandagiye. 
He also announced that UNHCR Assistant High Commissioner for Protection, Volker Türk, is visiting some African Great Lakes countries including Burundi and Rwanda by the end of this month. 
Relations between Burundi and Rwanda have deteriorated after Burundi accused Rwanda of hosting and supporting perpetrators of the May 13, 2015 coup plot against Burundian President Pierre Nkurunziza. 
Burundi has suffered turmoil since April 2015 when President Nkurunziza decided to run his controversial third term in violation of the national constitution and the 2000 Arusha Agreement that ended a decade-long civil war. 
More than 500 people in Burundi have been killed and the UN Refugee Agency estimates that about 300,000 people fled to neighboring countries mostly Tanzania, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) and Uganda since the outbreak of the crisis. Enditem

                            [text] => Travel South Africa records more tourist arrivals in August Tourist arrivals in South Africa saw a 14-percent increase year-on-year in August, according to figures released on Thursday. Oct 20, 2016 tweet 
A total of 833,638 tourist arrivals were recorded in August 2016, compared to 731,248 in the same month of last year, Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) said in its latest update on tourist arrivals in the country. 
The increase is evident in source regions including the Middle East (55 percent), followed by Asia (37.9 percent), Central and South America (24.9 percent), Europe (22.3 percent) and Australia (12.2 percent). 
“Tourists are finding value for money when they visit South Africa, and the recent arrival figures are a testament of that,” Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom said in response to the figures. 
The UK was the largest overseas source market for South Africa in August, maintaining the same trend of August 2015. China replaced Italy to become South Africa’s 14th source market. 
“As an industry, we are confident we can increase international tourist arrivals by 50 percent in the next five years through improved market access and innovating marketing ventures. The increase can only bode well for our economy and create much needed jobs for our people,” said Hanekom. Enditem

                            [text] => UN Special Rapporteurs urged to intervene to insure safety of Anu Muhammad Oct 20, 2016 human rights defender Mr Anu Muhammad 
Md. Shahriar Alam, 
State Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh. 
Fax: +880 2 9562188. 
I am William Nicholas Gomes, Human rights defender and Freelance journalist. 
I am writing to voice my deep concern regarding the death threats against Anu Muhammad. 
According to the information received by me, on 13 October 2016, human rights defender Mr Anu Muhammad received two messages on his phone threatening him with death. 
Anu Muhammad is a human rights defender working on environmental issues and is the member-secretary of the National Committee to Protect Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Power and Ports. He is the lead campaigner against the Rampal power plant project in Sundarbans, Khulna, southern Bangladesh. Anu Muhammad believes that the proposed coal-fired power plant project in Rampal would have an adverse and damaging impact on the ecosystem of Sundarbans, which is the world’s largest mangrove forest. 
On 13 October 2016, Anu Muhammad received two messages on his phone from the same number. The first one was sent at approximately 1 am and stated “Death keeps no calendar, and Ansatullah knows no time!”. The second one was sent at 8.43 pm, when he was on his way to Rampura police station to file a complaint about the first threat. It said “Say ‘yes’ to Rampal, otherwise, you must will be hacked to death incredibly by us!”. The term Ansatullah in the first message appears to refer to Ansarullah, which is an Islamic extremist group in Bangladesh that was responsible for the murder of secular activists, bloggers and publishers. Anu Muhammad has filed a complaint at the Rampura police station. 
I condemn the death threats against Anu Muhammad, as I believe the actions against him to be motivated by his legitimate and peaceful human rights activities in Bangladesh. I am particularly concerned for the safety of Anu Muhammad, given the sharp rise in extreme violence against human rights defenders in Bangladesh. 
I urge the authorities in Bangladesh to: 
Carry out an immediate, thorough and impartial investigation into the death threats against Anu Muhammad, with a view to publishing the results and bringing those responsible to justice in accordance with international standards; 
Take all necessary measures, in consultation with the defender, to guarantee the physical integrity and security of Anu Muhammad; 
Guarantee in all circumstances that all human rights defenders in Bangladesh are able to carry out their legitimate human rights activities without fear of reprisals and free of all restrictions. 

I want to inform you that I am also drawing urgent attention of the UN Special Rapporteurs on Freedom of Expression and Opinion, and on the Situation of Human Rights Defenders, calling for their intervention into this matter.

                            [text] => Election 2016: EIU Foretells A Win For Akufo-Addo Oct 20, 2016 tweet 
The Economic Intelligence Unit (EIU), a London-based organization, has predicted victory for the New Patriotic Party (NPP) in the forthcoming Ghana polls. 
“We expect Nana Akufo-Addo and the NPP to be victorious at the December presidential and legislative elections, given popular frustration with Ghana’s poor economic performance under the recent National Democratic Congress administration,” said the EIU in its October report. 
This prediction is the second from the EIU in the space of six months. Earlier in April, the EIU predicted a close win for the NPP. 
The EIU continued that “Pre-election spending in 2016 will put pressure on the fiscal deficit target set in conjunction with the IMF, although the government will be more successful at resisting large-scale populist spending than in previous election years.” 
This is not the first time the EIU is predicting the outcome of elections in the country – in February 2012, it predicted a win for the late President Prof. John Evans Mills, unfortunately he died before the elections were held.

                            [text] => Court Asks PPP, EC to File Their Statement of Case Oct 20, 2016 tweet 
The High court presided over by Justice Eric Kyei-Baffour has warned lawyers of both the Electoral Commission and Progressive People’s Party to file their statements of case simultaneously in the suit seeking judicial review of the disqualification of the PPP’s presidential candidate from the December polls. 
The court says it will at all times be guided by the timeline as far as election 2016 is concerned. As a result, the court has ordered that the filing be done by Monday October 24, and the parties will return to court the following day to make viva voce (oral submission) after which a date will be set for the judgement of the court. 
The founder and leader of the Progressive People’s Party, Dr. Papa Kwesi Nduom has stated that he would not give up easily following his disqualification from the presidential race in the upcoming December polls. 
The party thus sued the EC at the High Court seeking an order of prohibition to restrain the EC from proceeding with balloting for position of presidential candidates for the December 7, elections. 
It also sought for”…a further order directed against the 1st Respondent in her capacity as Returning Officer for Presidential elections to grant the Applicant the opportunity to amend and alter the one anomaly found in his nomination papers as well as accept his nomination papers as amended or altered to enable him contest as a Presidential Candidate for the 7th December 2016 elections.” 
“And for such order or further as to this Honourable Court may deem fit,” the PPP’s suit added. 
Dr Nduom and 11 others were disqualified from the contest by the EC. 
Some of the reasons outlined by the EC that led to the disqualification of the aspirants are filing anomalies including fraudulent signatures, absence of a required number of signatures and improper filling of nomination forms.

                            [text] => When Maria Grette Meets The Nigerian Who Scammed Her Oct 20, 2016 tweet 
An internet romance scam took an unexpected turn, writes Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani. 
When Maria Grette first discovered that the 58-year-old Danish man with whom she had fallen in love was actually a 24-year-old Nigerian “419” internet scammer, the 62-year-old Swede was distraught. But, soon, her feelings changed. 
“The most terrible thing was not that he had cheated me, but that he had lost his innocence,” she said.She became consumed with what she describes as “a profound need to make a difference to the people of Nigeria”.Ms Grette’s relationship with Johnny (not his real name) began after an evening of fun and games with her girlfriends, during which they playfully created a profile for her on an online dating website. A few years before, she had gone through a traumatic divorce, and her friends teased her about finally starting a new relationship. But when the fun of creating her profile was over, Ms Grette, who works as an arts teacher, painter and arts therapist, didn’t give much further thought to the website. “I received messages telling me that people had contacted me, but I never looked at them,” she said.Then, one day, she did. 
“I still don’t know why,” she said. “It was like a sudden impulse happening before I could stop it.”That particular message was from a man who described himself as a Dane raised in South Carolina, USA; a civil engineer working on a contract in England; a widower with a son in a Manchester university. “I was caught up by the atmosphere and by something in his words,” she said. The pre-ambleJohnny: “I wish I could see through your eyes and see what you like to see”Maria: “I like to see the truth, and often the truth is more beautiful and greater than people dare to realize”Johnny: “You talk in parable´s. I can´t wait to see you”Maria: “I cant understand how you can think so dedicated of me, when you have never met me. That scares me.”“We spent some time writing, then he called from a UK number.”Ms Grette, who had lived in different countries across Europe, was surprised that she could not place the man’s accent. She mentioned this to him but didn’t give it too much thought. He told her that he was planning for his retirement; had Sweden in mind for a place to settle; owned a house in Denmark inherited from his parents; wanted to leave that to his son, Nick, who was very attached to it, while he looked for a new home for himself in Sweden. 
“I wanted to meet him because I liked him,” she said. “He had a way and a sweetness I had never known in a man before. And he was innocent in a way that puzzled me.” 
Ms Grette put all these qualities down to “an old fashioned upbringing and an isolated life – living in hotels and spending his free time on golf courses owing to much travelling”.After three months of communicating, the man agreed to come over and visit her in Sweden. But before that, he and his son needed to make a quick trip to Nigeria for a job interview, he said.Johnny called to let her know that he was at Heathrow Airport. And to say that he had landed in Nigeria. He also got her to speak with Nick. The next phone call was to tell her that he was in a Lagos hospital. 
They had been mugged, his son shot in the head, and they were without money and papers. 
Unfortunately, his bank did not have a branch in Africa, he added, so it would take time to transfer money from his UK account. Meanwhile, the hospital management was requesting €1000 to proceed with treatment. 
The request 
“Honey, I am in the hospital right now using the doctor´s laptop to send you this message so you can know my situation. Honey, if Nick dies I will also die with him, I have been crying, I wish I could call you, I wish I never came here, I will never forgive myself for bringing Nick along with me. I will call you with the doctor´s phone and send you an email later if I have the chanse. 
“Honey, I am happy to hear from you and I am still at the hospital. The doctor said we where lucky we where not kidnapped. The bank does not have a location in Africa, so it will take time to get money and the management are requesting 1000 euros to proceed with treatment. Nick is all I have got and I will not forgive myself if anything happens to him. I am confused, and I do not know where to turn at the moment……”“I will never forget how I rushed to the Western Union office, trembling while I did the transfer,” Ms Grette said. 
“All I could think of was to get the two persons in Nigeria out of danger.”The plot developed after that initial transfer. Medical complications called for more money. The doctors demanded more advance fees.Several thousands of euro later, in what she describes as “coming to her senses”, Maria realised that something was amiss. She stopped responding to his messages.Three weeks after her silence, he called her and confessed. He told her that he was not who she thought he was. “I said I already knew that. I asked him to tell me his true identity and he did.”He was a 24-year-old Nigerian “419” scammer. He had finished university two years earlier but had no job. These kind of advance fee frauds are known as 419 scams in Nigeria after the section of the Criminal Code which covers fraud. 
He further described himself as a “devil” who had wronged “a lovely woman”. 
“He said he had never met anyone like me before, that he had been fighting his feelings for me for a long time. He said his scamming mates had warned him about falling in love with a ‘client’, that he had ignored them because he trusted me and did not want to lose contact with me.” 
The reveal 
From this point on, their communication took a new turn. There were no further requests for cash.“The attraction I started feeling was to the person who was revealing himself to me… It was still him, but with a new name and different age and circumstances,” she said. 
Johnny sent her a photograph of himself, but Maria was not satisfied with that. 
“I wanted to meet him,” she said. “I could not live with this relationship unless it was adjusted to reality in all senses.”Unable to get him a visa to travel to Sweden, she made up her mind to go to Nigeria. 
In October 2009, Ms Grette travelled to Africa for the first time in her life. 
“When I saw him at the airport in Abuja, tears fell over his face, and I knew I had known him all my life.”Ms Grette described her two weeks in Nigeria as blissful, a period during which she and Johnny succeeded in transforming their romantic feelings for each other into a good friendship. 
She met his friends, many of whom were also scammers. It was while enjoying their company one night in a local bar that she began to wonder how she could make a difference.“I asked myself what I could do to prevent a situation where healthy, good young men fall into this trap,” she said.An idea came to her two years later, in 2011, after she saw an article on a Nigerian news website about an arts exhibition.Over the past six years, Ms Grette has arranged for a number of African artists to visit Europe for arts exhibitions, workshops, conferences and competitions. 
She has assisted them to source international grants and other funding to advance their work.She has also visited Uganda to give talks on art, and is looking forward to another visit to Nigeria scheduled for later this year. 
Ms Grette, now 69 and living in Norway, is elated at the opportunity to improve the lives of these young artists.“Johnny has given me more than he took,” she said, “Without him, I would not have met Africa.” 
When she’d visited him in Abuja, Johnny promised Ms Grette that he would give up scamming. With her assistance, he left Nigeria shortly afterwards, to study in America. 
Although they have not met each other again since, she continued to provide him with financial assistance until he completed his degree a few years ago and got a job in the American oil sector. 
They still communicate frequently, updating themselves on each other’s lives; and last year, he bought one of her paintings which she shipped over to him in America. 
“He is very dear to me,” she said. “He has asked me so many times to forgive him and I told him that the most important thing is to forgive himself.”

                            [text] => Akufo-Addo: Mahama Knows He Had Done Poorly Oct 20, 2016 tweet 
President John Mahama’s continuous reiteration that he would deliver all his promises in his second term is a confirmation of his disastrous handling of the Ghanaian economy, the presidential nominee of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), has said. 
Speaking Thursday on Nyira FM in Kumasi, Nana Akufo-Addo said another four-year term under Mahama will further plummet the already sickening economy. 
“If he is given another two or three years, we might even experience a minus growth,” said Akufo-Addo, adding that the country’s economy since the return of the National Democratic Congress is heading to the abyss. 
He said the Ghana is now recording an economic growth of less than four percent contrary to Former President John Agyekum Kufour’s nine percent. 
Mahama, Akufo-Addo said, appears to be bereft of ideas hence his believe that another four years for him is a “threat to Ghana’s future.” 
He indicated that Mr. Mahama did not seem to have the ability to put the economy on the right trajectory and “that is what I mean by he is a threat to Ghana’s future. 
“Things are not going well, that is why he (Mr Mahama) keeps saying that people will really see his accomplishment in his next term,” he said.

                            [text] => Adwoa Safo Declared She Never Dated Samini Oct 20, 2016 tweet 
The Member of Parliament for Dome-Kwabenya, Adwoa Safo has said she never dated dancehall artiste, Samini as being rumoured. 
Asked by Bola Ray on Starr Chat , who her favourite dancehall artiste is, the lawmaker said “Samini comes first and I just love his style and we saw him come up and to be who he is now, but I never dated him.” 
She added: “We were just very good friends… my brother was actually part of the team that came up with his hit song ‘Linda’ and he is very close to the family and still very close. I think I also like Stonebwoy and my kids like Shatta Wale, we enjoy Kakai”. 
She went on to tip songstress, Becca, as her all-time Ghanaian musician. 
She was voted into office during the December 7, 2012 elections. She has promised to double her votes in the December 7 elections and urged Ghanaians to vote massively for her and the NPP’s flag bearer, Nana Akufo-Addo, who is in the race for the Flagstaff House for the third time running.

                            [text] => Election 2016: UK Maintains A Neutral Stand in Ghana’s Polls Oct 20, 2016 
The United Kingdom is not backing any candidate in the December 7 polls, the country’s High Commissioner to Ghana, Jon Benjamin has stated. 
“We, like other observers are neutral,” he told Citi FM Thursday, adding, “… we have no favoured candidates.” 
Addressing the imminent legal tussle likely to face the Electoral Commission (EC) following its disqualification of 12 presidential aspirants from contesting the December 7 race, Mr. Benjamin said he believes the courts will do a good job in getting the grievances of the disqualified candidates resolved. 
“I’m sure the courts will give the cases top priority so they’ll be resolved well ahead of the date for the polls,” he stated. 
The courts, he said, are there to resolve disputes emanating from political process “peacefully” in accordance with pre-existing laws, hence the need for patience. 
“We have respect for Ghana’s independent legal system, we’ll wait for the decision on the disqualified aspirants,” Mr. Benjamin stated. 
On ensuring peace before, during and after the December 7 polls, he said his outfit is working closely with the judiciary to deal administratively with court cases and the police on public security. 
The UK High Commission, he stated, is open to working with the Government of Ghana regardless of who wins the presidential race.

                            [text] => Samini confirms he ended his beef with Shatta Wale Oct 20, 2016 tweet 
Dancehall artiste, Samini, has said he ended his beef with rival Shatta Wale to promote peace ahead of the December polls. 
In an interview on Accra-based YFM, Samini said he did that to promote harmony between his High Grade Family crew and Shatta’s Shatta Movement Empire. 
“It happened all around the same time, in the morning I felt we were in the election year and it’s a few months to election and if it’s my rival’s birthday and I wanted to promote peace and set an example, it wouldn’t hurt a fly to wish the man a happy birthday on social media just to get both factions excited and get them to talk on social media about something positive. 
“Just when I posted the tweet, I realized he had also tweeted that he had followed my account to make himself happy and so I followed back and told him I followed back and that’s it,” Samini said.

The Electoral Commission Thursday morning held balloting to determine the positions of Member of Parliament aspirants on the ballot papers for the 2016 elections. 
At the end of the balloting, the Great Consolidated Popular Party (GCPP) captured the first position followed by the Progressive People’s Party (PPP) before the ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC). 
The United Progressive Party (UPP) came fourth with the main opposition New Patriotic Party (NPP) occupying the fifth position before the National Democratic Party (NDP) and the Independent People’s Party (IPP) in that order. 
The Convention People’s Party (CPP) had no representative at the balloting which took place at the headquarters of the Electoral Commission. 
“We’ll look at the order of the filing for the presidential to determine the positions for them [CPP and independent candidates],” the Commission announced after the brief exercise. 
Balloting for the independent candidates in the parliamentary elections will be done at the various district offices. 
The full balloting order:

                            [text] => Avram Prioritize Skysports Discussions Over AFCON Draw Oct 20, 2016 tweet 
Ghana’s coach Avram Grant refused to be in Gabon for the 2017 AFCON draw to enjoy studio discussions on Skysports as a pundit on English Premier League upcoming matches. 
Ghana has been paired in group D alongside Egypt, Uganda and Mali for the continental showpiece scheduled for 14 January to 5 February 2017 in the Gabonese cities of Libreville, Franceville, Oyem and Port Gentil. 
But the former Chelsea trainer has been busy sharing his views on the English Premier League matches this weekend as his opposite numbers and group contenders get firsthand knowledge of conditions in Gabon. 
Uganda coach Micho was present at the draw to inspect the city of Port Gentil and Hotel de Parc where both team will be lodging during the tourney. 
According to a close source to the Ghana FA, he defied every directive from management to leave for London after the South Africa friendly and he is believed to return in the first week of November. 
The former West Ham United and Portsmouth manager is under pressure to win the hearts of fans after Ghana’s shaky goalless start in the 2018 World Cup qualifiers in Tamale against the Cranes of Uganda.

                            [text] => NPP: Debrah Must Apologise for Careless Kalyppo Comment Oct 20, 2016 
The Chief of Staff Julius Debrah must withdraw and apologise over his recent comment asking adults to stay away from local fruit juice Kalyppo, an offshoot of the opposition New Patriotic Party (NPP) has said. 
The Truth Forum described Mr. Debrah’s statement as “irresponsible” and aimed at killing local businesses. 
“This brings back memories of terror on private entrepreneurship; and as a people, we must condemn such utterances in our political discourse. 
“We are therefore calling on Mr. Julius Debrah to apologise for the irresponsible statement, and also to the manufacturers of Kalyppo and the general public,” a statement signed by Anthony Karbo, a member of the Truth Forum and a communication member of the NPP said. 
Below is the full statement: 
NDC ATTACKS LOCAL INDUSTRY The Truth Forum, condemns the reckless and irresponsible pronouncements made by the Chief of Staff, Mr Julius Debrah, urging Ghanaians to stay away from Kalyppo, a locally-made fruit juice. 
It is rather unfortunate that, after 8years of making a complete mess of the Ghanaian economy, the John Mahama-led NDC government has decided to not only negatively tag our local industry, but take us back to the dark days in our history. 
It will be recalled that a few weeks ago, the flagbearer of the New Patriotic Party, Nana Akufo-Addo, was spotted in photograph drinking Kalyppo fruit juice. The photograph went viral on social media, with Ghanaians from all walks of life identifying with him by posting selfies mimicking him drinking the locally made juice. It is obvious that sales of Kalyppo has increased tremendously in recent times. 
Speaking to supporters of the governing National Democratic Congress (NDC) in the Brong Ahafo Regional town of Wenchi, Mr. Debrah said “adults who take very sweet fruit juices would go down with a sickness called “Kalyppolities.” The Chief of Staff has suddenly acquired medical qualification to determine what our population should or should not consume. 
After presiding over several years of unending power crisis, high taxes, petroleum price hikes, high utility tariffs, mismanagement of the economy, unstable currency which has resulted in collapse of many businesses and rendering hundreds of thousands of Ghanaians jobless, it is regrettable that such comments would come from the Chief of staff. Instead of outlining what has been done to curtail the energy crisis in the long-term, as well as measures put in place to make the business environment conducive for business to thrive, this is how low government has decided to sink. 
This brings back memories of terror on private entrepreneurship; and as a people, we must condemn such utterances in our political discourse. 
We are therefore calling on Mr. Julius Debrah to apologise for the irresponsible statement, and also to the manufacturers of Kalyppo and the general public.

                            [text] => NPP’s ‘1-District-1-Factory’ Has No Substance – Ahwoi Oct 20, 2016 tweet 
Local government expert and a founding member of the National Democratic Congress Prof. Kwamena Ahwoi argues the NPP’s proposal of ‘One Factory-One District’ is not feasible. 
According to him, the extension of electricity, water, building of roads, schools, and hospitals are necessary foundations for the building of a workable system of factories. 
“Without roads, electricity, water and all that President Mahama is building across the country how would factories work?” Prof. Ahwoi quizzed. 
Again he wondered how the proposal would be executed in reality when places like Tema already have over 400 factories. 
“Does that mean Tema will receive a factory too?” the veteran politician queried. 
Speaking at the NDC’s campaign rally in Brosankro in the Tano South constituency of the Brong Ahafo region the seasoned academic and politician also questioned the New Patriotic Party’s basis for criticising the NDC’s appointment of young people into government. 
He referred the teeming crowd to history when Dr Kwame Nkrumah, President JJ Rawlings and even himself were at the helm of national affairs at their youth. “It is therefore unfounded for them to keep looking down on the NDC for being a youthful party,” Prof. Ahwoi noted. 
He appealed to the supporters to vote massively for Mahama come the December 7 elections.

                            [text] => Zidan Promises to Beat Ghana Without Mercy Oct 20, 2016 tweet 
Egypt’s striker Mohamed Zidan has expressed his satisfaction with the 2017 AFCON Draw as the Pharaohs fell in Group D with Ghana again. 
The former Borussia Dortmund forward believes the Black Stars will be beaten on November 13 in the World Cup qualifier and will then go ahead next year to repeat the same feat in Gabon. 
“Falling in the same group as Ghana and Uganda is beneficial to us. Beating them in the World Cup Qualifiers will earn the players more confidence to beat them again in the AFCON,” Zidan told DMC sports channel. 
“Mali is a strong team. This generation of Egyptian footballers went through a lot of obstacles like the absence of the fans from Stadiums. However, we passed all these difficulties and the next period will be a great one for Egyptian football,” he added. 
“Comparing this generation to the past ones makes things harder for them. For instance, in 2010 we won against Ghana in the AFCON final with experience and self confidence, although they were physically way better than us,” he continued. 
He emphasized the importance of winning against the Black Stars in the World Cup Qualifiers. 
“Our current National team is gaining experience gradually. A win against Ghana in the World Cup qualifiers is easy and important to widen the gap to five points,” he concluded.

                            [text] => Akufo-Addo: Mahama Knows He Has Performed Poorly Oct 20, 2016 tweet 
President John Mahama’s continuous reiteration that he would deliver all his promises in his second term is a confirmation of his disastrous handling of the Ghanaian economy, the presidential nominee of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), has said. 
Speaking Thursday on Nyira FM in Kumasi, Nana Akufo-Addo said another four-year term under Mahama will further plummet the already sickening economy. 
“If he is given another two or three years, we might even experience a minus growth,” said Akufo-Addo, adding that the country’s economy since the return of the National Democratic Congress is heading to the abyss. 
He said the Ghana is now recording an economic growth of less than four percent contrary to Former President John Agyekum Kufour’s nine percent. 
Mahama, Akufo-Addo said, appears to be bereft of ideas hence his believe that another four years for him is a “threat to Ghana’s future.” 
He indicated that Mr. Mahama did not seem to have the ability to put the economy on the right trajectory and “that is what I mean by he is a threat to Ghana’s future. 
“Things are not going well, that is why he (Mr Mahama) keeps saying that people will really see his accomplishment in his next term,” he said.

                            [text] => US election: Trump says he will accept election results provided he wins Oct 20, 2016 tweet 
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has said he will accept the results of the US election “if I win”.He added that he would accept a “clear” result – but reserved the right to challenge a “questionable” result. 
He appeared at a rally in Delaware, Ohio, speaking for the first time since the third televised debate with Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. Mr Trump has been heavily criticised for suggesting that he might not accept the election result. 
Polls suggest Mrs Clinton is ahead nationally and in key battleground states. 
When moderator Chris Wallace asked Mr Trump during Wednesday night’s debate if he would accept losing to Mrs Clinton, Mr Trump said he would “keep you in suspense”. 
Mr Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, later insisted that the candidate had meant he would not concede until the “results are actually known”. 
The remark, which drew anger from some Republicans, is part of Mr Trump’s repeated claim that the election is “rigged” against him. 
Mr Trump told the Ohio audience that the election was posing questions about “the fairness of our country”.“I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States, that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election – if I win,” he said, grinning. 
He also said: “I will accept a clear election result, but I will also reserve my right to contest and file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result.” 
Thursday also saw former Republican presidential candidate Senator John McCain release a statement implicitly criticising Mr Trump’s debate comments. 
Mr McCain, who lost to Barack Obama eight years ago, said: “I didn’t like the outcome of the 2008 election. But I had a duty to concede, and I did so without reluctance. 
“A concession isn’t just an exercise in graciousness. It is an act of respect for the will of the American people, a respect that is every American leader’s first responsibility.”‘Lock her up’At the Ohio rally, Mr Trump also reiterated a claim he made during the debate against Mrs Clinton and President Obama, who he said were responsible for inciting violence at a Chicago rally earlier this year. 
The crowd erupted into cheers of: “Lock her up!” 
Mr Trump has trailed Mrs Clinton in the polls after facing damaging fallout over a video that emerged of him making obscene remarks about groping women. 
When asked to address the allegations made against him by several women in the wake of the video, Mr Trump said the claims had been “largely debunked”. 
The two candidates are scheduled to appear at a charity dinner on Thursday night in New York.

                            [text] => Nana vs Mahama’ Is Shatta Wale’s Latest Song for Peace Oct 20, 2016 tweet 
Dancehall artiste Shatta Wale has released his latest song to preach peace as Ghana heads to the polls on December 7, 2016. 
Produced by Willis Beatz, the song draws on his feud with Samini, his song ‘Mahama Paper’ as well as the recent Kalyppo craze on social media to preach tolerance during the elections. 
He advises Ghanaians to make their choice and not descend into violence. 
He humorously refers to the two candidates as Nana ‘Kalyppo’ and Mahama ‘Paper’.

                            [text] => Atwima Kwanwoma Chiefs: No One Has Endorsed Nana Addo Oct 20, 2016 tweet 
Chiefs in the Atwima Kwanwoma constituency of the Ashanti region have denied media reports suggesting that they have declared support for the candidature of the NPP flagbearer Nana Akufo-Addo ahead of the December polls. 
Reports are rife that the chiefs, numbering 58, pledged allegiance to the three-time flagbearer as he visited the area to campaign as part of his Ashanti regional campaign tour. 
Leader of of the chiefs Otumfuo Mpaboahene, Nana Yaw Owusu, is reported to have accused the Mahama-led administration of neglecting them because of their perceived loyalty to the NPP. 
But speaking to Nii Arday Clegg on the Morning Starr Thursday, Nana Yaw Owusu said the claim of their collective support for Akufo-Addo is not true. 
“ We didn’t come together to endorse Akufo-Addo as they are claiming and it is not true that we said President Mahama has neglected us. What we said was that because of our perceived association with the Danqua-Busia-Dombo tradition people tend to think that we support the NPP. So we only told Akufo-Addo to help fix our roads if he becomes President,” he explained. 
Meanwhile, the Catholic Bishops Conferenec has in a statement urged chiefs to desist from politics. 
“We entreat our kings and chiefs to protect the integrity of their stools and skins by refraining from meddling in partisan politics to the displeasure of their subjects as if to say that the party they associate with or endorse is representative of their subjects’ choice as well. 
“Politicians and traditional leaders must work to foster peace and seek the integral development of Ghanaians rather than to divide them,” the statement said

                            [title] => CCTV Footage Shows Gang Of Thieves In and Out of Kim K’s Apartment
                            [text] => CCTV Footage Shows Gang Of Thieves In and Out of Kim K’s Apartment   first images of five suspects said to have robbed Kim Kardashian of jewellery in Paris have today emerged in France. 
French media has published footage of the alleged gang leaving and arriving at the reality TV star’s VIP apartment on October 3. 
Shot on a private camera just around the corner from the so-called ‘Hotel de Pourtales’ apartment block they are in black and white. 
They are also so grainy that it is impossible to make out a single face, with detectives admitting they are still baffled as to who they are. 
The camera footage, released in an online exclusive by the M6 news channel, starts at 2.19am, and shows three men wearing reflective jackets cycling towards the block, and shortly afterwards two others walk past on foot. 
A full 49 minutes then goes by, before members of the gang are seen leaving – a time period that makes a mockery of previous claims that they only spent a few minutes in the building. 
All have their faces hidden by a combination of hoods and balaclavas, and are thought to be pretending to be plain-clothes policemen. 
Two of them head up to Ms Kardashian’s first floor apartment with the only security guard in the building. 
The guard, identified only as Abdulrahman, a 39-year-old Algerian national, has since confirmed the descriptions of the five criminals, saying how easy it was for them to get in. 
‘There was no real security at all. It’s a choice. The hotel doesn’t mind about security,’ said Abdulrahman. 
When the men leave at 3.07am they can be seen walking and cycling briskly, and all look very relaxed. 
Despite the CCTV, after more than two weeks the detectives are no closer to catching those responsible for the heist, in which Ms Kardashian says she had a gun pointed to her head, and was tied up and gagged, along with Abdulrahman. 
The multimillionaire, who was in the French capital for Paris Fashion Week, was locked in a bathroom while robbers stole a $4.5 million ring and a case of jewellery valued at $5.6 million. 
Ms Kardashian has, meanwhile, said she is prepared to return to France if summoned by a judge leading the investigation. 
The 35-year-old left the country within a few hours crime, but Jean Veil, the barrister acting for her in Paris, said ‘she is very calm and very determined over a matter that was particularly violent’. 
Mr Veil has hit out at those who say the entire robbery was a set up aimed at attracting publicity. 
The five men thought to have been involved in the robbery face charges of ‘armed robbery by an organised gang, criminal conspiracy and kidnapping’.

                            [title] => Election 2016: Debrah Calls For Violence Free Elections
                            [text] => Election 2016: Debrah Calls For Violence Free Elections   Chief of Staff Julius Debrah has reiterated the need for the youth to desist from acts that could threaten the peace, security and unity in Ghana, especially during and after the December 7 general elections. 
Speaking at Tanoso South during a campaign tour of the Brong Ahafo Region, he said it does not pay for any individual or group of persons to compromise the serenity and cohesion being enjoyed in the country. 
The Chief of Staff indicated that democracy is not warfare but an opportunity for people to speak their minds on pertinent issues in the country, thus the need to stay peaceful and united for a progressive course. 
“As we have come to see you sing, clap and energized, it’s healthy. I am the President’s Chief of Staff, when I wake up in the morning I don’t go to the President’s house to say let me enjoy the food that your wife had prepared. 
“The same way when you in this area and you follow a political party and you engage in violence and got yourself maimed, you couldn’t go to the party in future and say, I was the one who was maimed with a knife so give me food to eat,” Mr Debrah said. 
He thus pleaded with the chiefs and people of Tonoso South to allow brotherly love to prevail at all times to pave the way for progress and development. 
Mr Debrah noted President John Mahama has a lot of plans for the people of the Brong Ahafo region hence it will be suicidal for any of the people to plunge the area into chaos, saying , “if that happens development in the area would stall”. 
He added: “The president who happens to be your in law is a honest and credible man who has the country’s forward march at heart, and will do anything to fulfill the social contract he has signed with you”. 
He advised that “if they provoke you ignore them and let them take their fight to the bush to fight the elephant, the umbrella family doesn’t fight for political expediency.” 
The Chief of Staff is in the Brong Ahafo region in the company of other leading members of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) campaign team: Madam Faustina Nelson, Professor Kwamena Ahwoi and Mr. Kofi Totobi Quakye. 
They have visited Chiraa, Bonsakro and other communities in the week-long tour urging the chiefs and people to vote massively for President Jon Mahama and the aspiring members of parliament in the region to guarantee accelerated development. 
He indicated that it was important for the chiefs and people to demonstrate their love for the First Lady, Mrs Lordina Mahama, who is a native of the area, by voting massively for President Mahama, to enable him double up the socio-economic development of the area.

                            [text] => ACEP Urge Ghanaians to Monitor The Usage of Oil Revenue Oct 20, 2016 tweet 
Ghanaians are being urged to show more interest in how revenue from the oil and gas industry is utilised for development purposes. 
Over the past five years, oil revenue has contributed more than 75 percent to government’s expenditure. But most people, especially those in the areas where the exploration activities take place say the money is not being utilized properly. 
Speaking Thursday during the Voter’s Compass — a segment on Morning Starr on Starr 103.5FM sponsored by Penplusbyte and the United States Embassy in Ghana, Dr. Ishmael Ackah, Head of Policy at the Africa Centre for Energy Policy (ACEP), said it was welcoming for citizens to demand accountability regarding how the monies accrued from the country’s oil and gas industry are being spent. 
Oil and Gas, he said have become important aspect of “our economy” but there is an urgent need to ensure that as a nation, “we don’t depend” solely on revenues from the industry. 
Efforts, he said must be made to diversify the economy using the oil and gas resources of the country as a catalyst. 
“We all have to support,” stated Dr. Ackah.

                            [text] => Mahama Advise Local Manufacturers to Utelise ECOWAS Trade Protocols Oct 20, 2016 tweet 
President John Mahama has thrown a challenge to local manufacturers to take advantage of ECOWAS protocols on trade to venture into other markets within the region. 
According to the president, agreements such as the ECOWAS Trade Liberalization Scheme which Ghana has signed on to, allow for companies within the bloc to export their products to neighboring countries duty free when they satisfy certain conditions. 
Citing the importation of cement from Nigeria as an example, Mahama said on Volta Star Radio in the Volta region that there was nothing wrong with the practice and urged Ghanaian industrialists to do same. 
“So we have ECOWAS Trade Liberalization Scheme [ETLS], if your product has more than 60% of local raw material then you can export it into another ECOWAS country duty free that’s one of the reasons why we have a company like Dangote exporting into the Ghanaian market, so I will encourage Ghanaian traders to export into Burkinabe market, Nigeria etc,” Mahama said.

                            [text] => NDC, CPP Aspirants Say Effia MP is Incompetent Oct 20, 2016 tweet 
The parliamentary aspirants of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) and the Convention People’s Party (CPP) in the Effia constituency – Michael Otu and Elder Isaac Badu – have launched a scathing criticism on the records of the incumbent MP of the area Joseph Cudjoe, accusing him of “gross incompetence”. 
According to them, the incumbent MP has woefully underperformed thus the need to ditch him for a more competent individual. 
Speaking during Starr Voters’ Voice Thursday, Mr. Otu stated even though the constituency has consistently voted for the NPP, the party deserted it during the erstwhile Kufuor administration. 
This, he said, was as a result of gross incompetence from the incumbent MP and his predecessors. He said the few developments currently visible in the constituency was the initiative of President John Mahama. 
He continued that owing to the level of impoverishment in the area, the incumbent MP has no business seeking for another term come the December 7, 2016 elections. 
In reaction, Mr. Cudjoe urged the constituents to ignore what he described as “misleading statement” from a bunch of “ignoramus.” 
He said claims of despondency in the constituency are nothing, but misguided propaganda, stating that his achievements are undoubtedly matchless and ubiquitous. 
The Starr Voters’ Voice is a programme under the auspices of the EIB Election Hub and powered by Penplusbyte and the United States Embassy in Ghana. 
During the questions and answer session, the constituents sided with the concerns of the aspirants of the NDC and CPP. They accused their MP of misappropriation of the MPs Common Fund—an assertion the MP branded as “part of the wild propaganda.”

                            [text] => World News San Francisco police investigate bomb threat Police at San Francisco, a city on the U.S. west coast, investigated a bomb threat involving a white car on Thursday and rendered the scene safe more than three hours later. Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) initially posted messages on Twitter social network that its bomb squad was on the scene assisting the probe after receiving notification of a vehicle, and public is advised to shelter in place. 
However, at about 2:30 p.m. local time, SFPD said the scene near the city’s Hall of Justice was safe and streets would reopen in the area. 
ABC7 News showed video footage of a robot apparently trying to open the vehicle’s trunk, and a source told the ABC network local affiliate that the car had a note on a window claiming there was a bomb. 
The car was in a tow yard underneath Highway 80, which has heavy traffic most time of the day heading into San Francisco or out toward the East Bay city of Oakland across the historic Bay Bridge. 
Among locations closed as a precaution was the Hall of Justice, which serves as SFPD’s operational headquarters, the main San Francisco County Jail, as well as base of operations and headquarters for the San Francisco Sheriff’s Department, and garage for the majority of SFPD vehicles. The building was evacuated and court cancelled. 
SFPD spokeswoman Officer Giselle Talkoff talked with media but did not provide details.

                            [text] => AU dispatch a team of long-term election observers to Ghana The African Union (AU) has approved deployment of a long-term election observation mission to Ghana. Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
Following an invitation from the government of Ghana, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Chairperson of the AU Commission, has approved the deployment of the mission to Ghana’s presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled for December 7 this year, said an AU statement on Thursday. 
The mission will be deployed on Oct. 20 and will remain in the country until the announcement of final results, according to the statement. 
The mission comprised 4 core team analysts and 10 long-term observers from eleven African countries, including Cameroon, Egypt, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. 
The observers are mandated to observe, assess and report on the electoral preparations and other developments in the country at national and regional levels, aiming to provide an impartial assessment and, where relevant, recommend ways for improvement, said the statement. 
“The deployment of an AU long-term election observation mission to Ghana reflects our desire and aspiration for an Africa of good governance, democracy, respect for human rights, justice and the rule of law in all of our member states”, said Dlamini-Zuma in the statement. 
The long-term observation mission will conduct its work in an independent, nonpartisan and professional manner, said the statement. Enditem

                            [text] => World News Syria blames Turkish airstrikes on the death of 150 people in Aleppo The Syrian army on Thursday accused Turkish airstrikes of killing 150 people in the countryside of the northern province of Aleppo a day earlier, state news agency SANA reported. Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
The general command of the Syrian army said the Turkish airstrikes on towns and villages in the northern countryside of Aleppo had targeted “innocent people” and constituted a “dangerous development that will further complicate the situation.”

[Photo/Agencies] Meanwhile, the army threatened to down any Turkish plane that would violate the Syrian airspace. 
“Any further violation to the Syrian airspace by the Turkish warplanes will be dealt with by downing them with all possible means,” the statement said. 
The Turkish air forces and tanks have been backing several rebel groups in an operation dubbed the Euphrates Shield, which aims primarily at thwarting the advance of the Kurdish forces near the Turkish borders, and dislodge the Islamic State (IS) group from the areas they hold in northern Syria.

                            [text] => Inside Africa UNSC Salutes Guinea-Bissau’s inclusive dialogue among parties The UN Security Council on Thursday welcomed an inclusive dialogue among political leaders, civil society and religious communities of Guinea-Bissau to end the country's current political crisis. Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
Between Oct. 11-14, the dialogue was convened in Conakry, capital of Republic of Guinea by mediators, during which the country’s political rivals agreed to allow Prime Minister Baciro Dja to stay on until 2018 as a step forward in talks to end more than a year of infighting. 
In May this year, President of Guinea-Bissau Jose Mario Vaz named Baciro Dja as the country’s prime minister. The appointment triggered immediate opposition from the ruling African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC). 
In a statement issued here, the 15-nation council welcomed the initiative, which is part of a roadmap agreed last month to end the political crisis in the West African country. 
The council members said they support the consensus reached on the process for the nomination of a new prime minister and for the formation of an inclusive government in accordance with the agreement. 
Guinea-Bissau has been unstable as the country has witnessed several coups since 1980.

                            [text] => Inside Africa AU supports WFP with US$200k for refugees in Lake Chad The African Union (AU)donated 200,000 U.S. dollars to World Food Program (WFP) Thursday in N'Djamena to finance projects in favor of refugees in the Lake Chad region. Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
Ghana Ambassador to AU Albert Yankey said at the donating ceremony that the money will strengthen the WFP program in the fight against malnutrition, and develop school feeding program for refugees in the region. 
Yankey, who conducted a humanitarian assessment mission to Bagassola, in the region of the Lake Chad Basin, said he understood the value and importance of the assistance provided by WFP and other UN agencies to displaced persons and refugees. 
In this region of Chad which borders Niger, Nigeria and Cameroon, and has been struck by the atrocities of the Nigerian terrorist sect Boko Haram, WFP had set up in January 2015 an emergency operation which has provided a food and nutrition assistance to 130,000 displaced people and about 6,500 Nigerian refugees. 
According to Deputy Director of WFP in Chad, Issa Sanogo, the demand is enormous in the field, but there is a shortage of finance.

                            [text] => Nigeria 3,000 illegal residents apprehended in Nigeria Operatives of the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) on Thursday arrested over 3,000 suspected illegal foreign immigrants in Lagos, the nation's economic hub, in several raids, an NIS source said. Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
The early morning raids saw about 40 heavily armed officers combing motor parks, kiosks, hotels and some relaxation centers known to be frequented by the foreigners. 
During the raids, the NIS officers shot intermittently into the air as some immigrants took to their heels in the midst of the pandemonium. 
Many of the arrested aliens were from countries such as Ghana, Benin Republic, Niger, Mali, Cote d’Ivoire and Togo. 
An immigration source told Xinhua that the arrests of the suspected illegal aliens must have been sparked off by growing speculations that majority of the illegal aliens might actually be members of the outlawed Boko Haram sect. 
The source said the arrested aliens would be thoroughly and methodically screened and those who have valid papers would be released while others would be deported.

                            [text] => News Ghana: state prosecutors commence strike over wages State attorneys in Ghana declared Thursday an indefinite strike over government's inability to resolve outstanding issues on their salaries. Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
National president of the Association of State Attorneys (ASA), Francisca Tete-Mensah, confirmed here that they were demanding payment of arrears and provision of some office equipment. 
“This is a total strike where members will stay at home and not go to work,” Tete-Mensah said. 
The group last week issued a seven-day ultimatum for the enforcement of an order to harmonize their salaries with that of members of the lower bench. 
The National Labor Commission (NLC) last week attempted to resolve the impasse between the government and the state lawyers but failed to arrive at an amicable resolution. 
The attorneys expressed their displeasure at the government’s failure to comply with the NLC’s Compulsory Arbitration Award in Sept. 28, 2015, which is aimed at improving salaries and conditions of service of state attorneys. 
Meanwhile, the country’s Employment and Labor Relations Minister Haruna Iddrisu is expected to meet the state attorneys to find an end to the strike. 
State attorneys, numbering about 150, in July 2015 declared an indefinite strike action over poor conditions of service.

                            [title] => 200 displaced orphans get scholarship in Northeastern Nigeria
                            [text] => 200 displaced orphans get scholarship in Northeastern Nigeria At least 200 Internally Displaced Orphans in restive northeastern Nigeria have been provided scholarship. Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
The orphans were drawn from camps in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states. 
The gesture was to assist in educating the unaccompanied children living in various Internally displaced persons (IDPs) camps in the three states, Sheikh Arif Zabaden, head of the Abdul-Lateef Zabaden Orphanage in Maiduguri, capital of Borno State, said while presenting the scholarship through Adamawa government at a ceremony on Thursday in Yola. 
Zabaden said the beneficiaries were selected after intensive screening, noting that the orphans are of between the ages of seven and nine years, and that they would enjoy the scholarship from primary school to secondary school. 
He said after their graduation, the orphanage would enroll them into a skills acquisition training program to enable them to become self-reliant. 
There are about 49,000 unaccompanied children in various camps in the Northeast Nigeria as a result of the Boko Haram crisis, according to crisis management reports. 
The Boko Haram insurgency, which began in 2009, has left nearly 20,000 people dead and millions displaced. Enditem

The very sensational singer, Sista Afia teams up with Highgrade Family’s very own Kofi Kinaata to bring us this new masterpiece, Yiwani. It has very inspiring and soul lifting lyrics which gives music lovers a million reasons to keep moving on in life and not to give up no matter the situation. 
Sista Afia was struck by the unique words of the song when she sat to think through the realities of today’s life taking into account the current generation, where many people witness disappointments on daily basis. 
Just when one feels like giving up and being fed up, ‘YiWani’ is there to breathe some new spirit of possibilities in any endeavour for people to carry on and move on to the next stage of life. Sista Afia, is a UK-based Ghanaian Hilife songstress. 
‘YiWani’, earlier received a lot of endorsements since the track has already been embraced by many radio stations, online music promoters among other stakeholders in the entertainment industry.

                            [text] => Ceasefire violations extends Yemen’s peace process Ceasefire violations deepen uncertainty of peace process in Yemen Oct 21, 2016 
Yemen’s dominant Shiite Houthi group traded accusations with Saudi Arabia on Friday over breaching a ceasefire mediated by the United Nations, deepening the uncertainty of the peace process in the country. 
The UN-brokered 72-hour ceasefire, meant to last for three days, came into effect on Wednesday midnight. 
According to a statement released by Houthi-run media, a Thursday night air strike by the Saudi-led coalition killed three civilians in the northern province of Saada. 
The coalition accused the Houthis of firing rockets on the southern Saudi cities of Jazan and Najran, killing two civilians, according to a statement by Saudi official media. 
Meanwhile, Saudi-backed Yemeni government of exiled President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi said its troops in the Yemeni central province of Marib shot down three missiles fired by Houthis late on Thursday. 
The ceasefire is aimed at facilitating humanitarian aid supplies to the war-stricken cities. 
UN officials hoped the truce would be extended to pave the way for resuming stalled peace talks and to end the war. 
Previous attempts to cease fire between warring parties in Yemen had hardly been observed, with all sides involved in the conflict trading accusations of violating the truce. 
Ceasefires backed by the UN are frequently interrupted. 
On March. 23, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, special envoy of the UN secretary-general for Yemen, announced that a nationwide ceasefire in Yemen was scheduled to begin in April, and peace talks scheduled to begin in Kuwait. 
However, the Houthis accused Saudi-led coalition warplanes of killing seven Houthi followers in the Houthi-held capital Sanaa on May 8, which triggered the Houthi and Saleh delegations to walk out of the talks in protest. 
A day later, the warring parties came back to the peace table in Kuwait and in June the UN special envoy said that “after extensive discussions with the participants, the main principles that will guide the next phase of Yemeni talks had been established.” 
Talks continued while Houthi group and the Saudi-led coalition accused each other of violating the ceasefires. 
On Oct. 17, the UN declared that a 72-hour ceasefire between Houthi fighters and their rival Saudi-backed exiled government forces will take effect at 2359 local time (2059 GMT) on Oct. 19. 
However, the ceasefire became fragile after the warring sides traded accusations of breaching it. 
The conflict in Yemen began after Arab-spring style 2011 mass protests that eventually forced former President Ali Abdullah Saleh out of power. 
The Houthis, supported by Saleh, seized the Yemeni capital Sana’a and some other Yemeni cities in September 2014, forcing President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and his government into exile. 
The Houthis and their ally forces loyal to Saleh have controlled most of Yemen’s northern regions since September 2014, while the Saudi-backed Hadi’s government has worked with its tribal allies in the southern provinces they recaptured from Houthi rebels. 
The Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen’s conflict in March 2015 with an air force campaign to restore Hadi to the power and roll back Houthi gains. 
The 19-month civil war has killed over 10,000 people, mostly civilians. Enditem

                            [title] => Cameroon launches e-commerce site to promote local handicraft products
                            [text] => Technology Cameroon launches e-commerce site to promote local handicraft products Cameroon launched Thursday the country's first e-commerce site in capital Yaounde to connect local handicraft products with international market. Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
The site, www.cameroongallery.com, is the first of its kind in sub-Sahara. 
On behalf of Prime Minister Philemon Yang, Small and Medium Enterprises Minister Laurent Serge Etoundi Ngoa, hailed the project for providing great opportunity to promote the local handicraft products home and abroad. 
“The Cameroonian craftsmen have long suffered from the underestimation of their products which enjoy nevertheless the good quality,” he said in the inaugural speech. 
“In a globalized world, where economies are now linked together, we should be creative and intelligent to ensure our products not only popular but also widely consumed,” said the minister. 
Cameroon is an influential member of Co-ordinating Committee for the Development and Promotion of African Handicraft (CODEPA), an interafrican organization consisting of 26 African countries. 
In addition to Yaounde, the e-commerce site has an antenna in Limbe, a city in southwest of Cameroon. Enditem

                            [text] => Inside Africa South African cabinet approves publishing of hate crime bill The cabinet of South Africa has approved that a bill on hate crime and hate speech be published for soliciting public comments, Minister in the Presidency for Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Jeff Radebe said Thursday. Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
The Prevention and Combating of Hate Crimes and Hate Speech Bill seeks to create the offences of hate crimes and hate speech and to put in place measures to prevent and combat these offences, Radebe said at a press briefing in Pretoria after a cabinet meeting. 
The aim is to address the increasing number of racial incidents and to further address other types of criminal conducts motivated by bias, prejudice or intolerance, in the form of hate crimes and hate speech, the minister said. 
This is in line with the National Development Plan which highlights the need for sustained campaigns against racism, sexism, homophobia and xenophobia, he added. 
This came as the country had seen an increase in the manifestation of hate speech and hate crimes. 
Earlier this year, Penny Sparrow, a former estate agent, made headlines when she vented her displeasure at the number of black people swarming public beaches in Durban during the New Year holiday, likening them to “monkeys.” Her comments went viral on social media and caused a public uproar. 
According to the bill, a hate crime is committed if a person commits a common law or statutory offence (referred to as the “base crime or offence”) while being motivated by unlawful bias, prejudice or intolerance. Enditem

                            [text] => Emerging Markets Namibia to gazette new tariffs before EPA implementation Namibia has prepared new tariffs ahead of implementing the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) signed in June this year in Botswana. Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
Although Namibia ratified the agreement in Aug. 2016 after signing as a bloc together with Mozambique, Lesotho, Swaziland, Botswana, and South Africa, it is yet to gazette it. 
Finance minister Calle Schlettwein, who attended a media briefing Thursday called for by the European Union Ambassador to Namibia, said the new tariffs will be gazetted next month. 
Until the new tariffs are gazetted, he said, the old ones will be in force. 
The EU is Namibia’s biggest importer of beef and fish products.

                            [text] => Technology Cameroon launches ecommerce site to promote local handicraft products Cameroon launched Thursday the country's first e-commerce site in capital Yaounde to connect local handicraft products with international market. Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
The site, www.cameroongallery.com, is the first of its kind in sub-Sahara. 
On behalf of Prime Minister Philemon Yang, Small and Medium Enterprises Minister Laurent Serge Etoundi Ngoa, hailed the project for providing great opportunity to promote the local handicraft products home and abroad. 
“The Cameroonian craftsmen have long suffered from the underestimation of their products which enjoy nevertheless the good quality,” he said in the inaugural speech. 
“In a globalized world, where economies are now linked together, we should be creative and intelligent to ensure our products not only popular but also widely consumed,” said the minister. 
Cameroon is an influential member of Co-ordinating Committee for the Development and Promotion of African Handicraft (CODEPA), an interafrican organization consisting of 26 African countries. 
In addition to Yaounde, the e-commerce site has an antenna in Limbe, a city in southwest of Cameroon.

                            [text] => Election 2016: NPP Refuse to Honour Mahama’s Debate Challenge Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
The New Patriotic Party (NPP) has rejected the challenge from President John Mahama for Nana Addo to debate him one-on-one. 
The president once again in an interview with Volta Star FM in Ho, dared Nana Akufo-Addo to debate him on national issues ahead of the presidential elections. 
But the NPP says its presidential candidate would not accept the president’s challenge. Communications director of the NPP, Nana Akomea said the party has moved past the debate. 
“When IEA offered their platform for us to debate the NDC and Mahama rejected it, so one month to elections what does the President think that now he wants a debate all of a sudden, we have moved past the debate because he withdrew from the debate… what is he going to tell us at the debate that he can’t tell us anywhere,” Akomea said.

                            [text] => Ghana’s 2017 Budget Expenditure Gets Approval Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
Parliament has approved GH¢10.9 billion for government expenditure for the first quarter of 2017. 
The money will be used for the payment of salaries, service interest on loans among other critical financial endeavors. 
About GH¢2 billion will be used to pay for interests on loans, GH¢2.3 billion for grants to government agencies, while about GH¢4 billion will be used to pay for salaries and compensation government employees. 
The budget presentation became necessary because of the December 7, polls and the need to prevent overspending in case of a transition in government. 
The finance minister in July this year sought approval from parliament to spend an additional 1.8 billion Cedis for the remaining of 2016.

                            [text] => Kalyppo Comment: Mahama is collapsing Ghanaian businesses Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
The 2016 presidential candidate of the New Patriotic Party, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, has described as reckless, the comments made by Chief of Staff of the Mahama administration, Julius Debrah, who, whilst campaigning in the Brong Ahafo region, urged Ghanaians to stop patronizing made-in-Ghana fruit juice beverage, Kalyppo. 
According to Nana Akufo-Addo, after killing Ghanaian businesses in the last eight years because of poor policies, the Mahama government is now actively campaigning to collapse Ghanaian businesses, which employ thousands of people across the country. 
“I have heard one of Mahama’s appointees (Chief of Staff, Julius Debrah) saying that Ghanaians should no longer consume Kalyppo because it contains sugar. So after killing Ghanaian businesses, they are now campaigning to make sure that no one patronises made-in-Ghana products, and thereby collapse Ghanaian businesses? Ghanaians should not pay heed to such loose-talk from officials of the Mahama government,” he said. 
Nana Akufo-Addo continued, “If, indeed, sugar was bad, why have they set up the Komenda sugar factory, a factory they have made so much noise about? To them, sugar is bad and, yet, they spent so much money on the Komenda sugar factory, which is not even working? This propaganda will not work.” 
The NPP flagbearer stressed that “this year, whatever it is they say, whatever propaganda they churn out, will not work. Ghanaians are going to vote and bring into office an Akufo-Addo government, which is going to improve the wellbeing of Ghanaians. The wind of change is blowing all across Ghana, and nothing, nothing, is going to stop it from succeeding.” 
Nana Akufo-Addo was addressing a mammoth night rally at Kwadaso, on Thursday, October 20, 2016, at the end of day-2 of his 4-day campaign tour of the Ashanti region, when he made this known. 
The NPP flagbearer maintained that Ghanaians have one simple task ahead of them in this year’s elections. 
“The task is to use our thumbs to unseat Mahama and bring in a government led by Akufo-Addo. I am here to appeal to residents of Kwadaso, Kumasi and Asanteman to throw their support behind me, like never before. I want you to vote massively for me, so we can go into Jubilee House and do a job for all Ghanaians which will create jobs, wealth and prosperity for all Ghanaians,” he added. 
Nana Akufo-Addo assured the thousands and thousands gathered that he, together with the NPP, is seeking the mandate of the Ghanaian people, so as to be able to use it to implement the policies and programmes which will return Ghana onto the path of progress and prosperity. 
“These policies include the revival of the National Health Insurance Scheme, the effective implementation of the Free SHS policy, the 1-District-1-Factory policy, the establishment of the Infrastructure for Poverty Eradication Programme (IPEP), which will ensure that every constituency will receive the equivalent of $1million dollars every year to address developmental issues in the 275 constituencies, amongst others. I will implement all of these policies to the letter,” he assured. 
The NPP flagbearer, in concluding, urged residents of Kwadaso to rally behind the NPP’s parliamentary candidate for the constituency, Dr. Samiu Nuamah, and vote massively for him, so the party can eclipse the 83.82% margin of victory obtained in the 2012 elections.Nana Akufo-Addo also campaigned in the Manhyia South, Atwima Nwabiagya and Adansi Asokwa constituencies on Thursday.

                            [text] => US election: Obama Renders Trump’s Election Rhetoric As Dangerous Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
President Barack Obama has said Republican Donald Trump’s insistence that he might not accept the election result is “dangerous”. 
Speaking at a campaign rally in Miami for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, the president said Mr Trump’s comments undermined American democracy. 
Mr Trump refused in a televised debate to say he would accept the outcome of the election on 8 November.He later said he would accept a “clear” result but left a challenge open. 
Speaking in Ohio on Thursday, Mr Trump said, with a grin: “I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States, that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election – if I win.” 
In the same speech, he said he would accept a clear election result but reserved the right to file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable one. 
Hours later, the president said that sowing the seeds of doubt in people’s minds about the legitimacy of US elections provided a boost to the country’s enemies. 
“You’re doing the work of our adversaries for them, because our democracy depends on people knowing that their vote matters,” said Mr Obama. 
Mr Trump has been heavily criticised by many in his own party by suggesting he might not accept the election result. 
For days, he has claimed the election is rigged against him, due to media bias and voter fraud.During Wednesday night’s debate with Mrs Clinton, when moderator Chris Wallace asked Mr Trump if he would accept losing to her, the Republican nominee said he would “keep you in suspense”. 
Mr Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, later insisted that the candidate had meant he would not concede until the “results are actually known”. 
Republican Senator John McCain, who lost to Mr Obama eight years ago, said: “A concession isn’t just an exercise in graciousness. It is an act of respect for the will of the American people, a respect that is every American leader’s first responsibility.” 
First Lady Michelle Obama also joined the attack on Thursday, saying “you do not keep American democracy in suspense”.

                            [text] => ‘Mad Man’ & ‘Illiterate MP’ cross swords On 

From Alfred Adams, Takoradi. The Member of Parliament (MP) for Ekumfi Constituency in the Central Region, Mr. Abeiku Crentsil, yesterday caused a stir on a live radio show in Takoradi, when he went bonkers, refusing to debate Ebenezer Spio, Spokesperson for Essilfie Buckman, who has resigned as Constituency Chairman of the ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC) in the Ekumfi Constituency. 
Instead of responding to the circumstances leading to his Chairman’s resignation and subsequent defection to the New Patriotic Party (NPP), which was why the MP was called into the show, Abeiku Crentsil rather decided to employ a smart game, by attacking the intelligence of the Spokesperson. 
Pushed by the host of the show, Kwame Malcolm, to respond to the allegation surrounding the role the MP himself had allegedly played, leading to the resignation of the Constituency Chairman, MP Crentsil shockingly told the host that he would not debate a ‘mad man’ (referring to the Spokesperson). 
This was when the MP was asked by the host of the show to hold the line for the Spokesperson to react to the MP’s earlier statement. 
But, before the Spokesperson could do that, the MP shockingly told the host he would not speak to a ‘mad man’ on radio. “What do you mean Sir?” asked the host of the show. 
Crentsil then proceeded to explain what he meant by referring to the gentleman who called himself the Spokesperson as a ‘mad man’. 
According to the MP, Ebenezer Spio was a known ‘mad man’ in the constituency. As a result, “Can’t I speak to a mad man,” MP Crentsil was heard saying loudly on radio. 
For this reason, he requested the host of the show to end the interview since there was no way he could speak and debate a known ‘mad man’. 
“Do you have his medical record to suggest that he is a mad man?” asked Kwame Malcolm Interestingly, the MP, who responded in the opposite, rather went on the defensive, arguing that it was a known fact in the Ekumfi traditional area that Ebenezer Spio is a mad man, and then dropped the line. 
Responding, Ebenezer Spio decried the description by the MP. To Spio, he was not perturbed by the MP’s description of him, and that he would prefer to be referred to as mad man, than have an MP who could not construct a simple sentence in English. 
It would be recalled that the Ekumfi Constituency Chairman of the ruling party, Essilfie Buckman, resigned on Monday from the party, accusing the MP and executives of dirty deals. 
The resignation of the Chairman comes exactly three weeks after the NDC Constituency Organiser in Shama, in the Western Region, also resigned from the party over alleged dirty contract deals. 
According to Mr. Buckman, his decision was based on a raw deal meted out to him by the NDC during last year’s parliamentary primaries. 
He explained at a press conference on Monday that prior to the November 21 primary, executives of the party schemed to disqualify the two main challengers to the incumbent MP, Abeiku Crentsil. His opposition to the move saw his name mysteriously expunged from the register. He said as a result, he could not vote. Mr Buckman claims that a meeting to resolve the wrangling in the party was convened in Accra, and subsequently ended with an agreement on GH¢1,000 for “reconciliatory refreshment.””I regret, however, to state that as I speak to you, this has never happened, and I do not know when it would be done,” he told journalists. “I want to ask where the money is; Na sika no wo hen ?” Mr. Buckman, who arrived at the venue for the press conference in a political suit, quickly grabbed a T-shirt of the NPP parliamentary candidate, Ato Cudjoe, and wore it. He said there had also been several decisions taken behind his back. 
For instance, the Constituency Chairman claims a Toyota Mahindra vehicle meant for him was given to the Constituency Treasurer without his knowledge.

In her time as First Lady, Michelle Obama has shown an unparalleled sense of poise, navigating her responsibilities with the utmost style and grace. 
And on the eve of her final state dinner, Mrs. Obama joined her husband, President Obama, on the White House lawn in one of her signature Gi 
ambattista Valli fit-and-flare A-line dresses. 
Though the palette of white, black and gray was quite different from the colorful look she has worn in the past, the dress’s chevron pattern and knife-pleated skirt was no less eye-catching. The embellished neckline added a subtly glamorous finish, too, while the thin black belt was a figure-flattering touch. 
Of course, the question on everyone’s minds right now is what the First Lady will wear to tonight’s state dinner—will she choose Gucci again, given that the dinner is in honor of the Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s official visit ? 
Could this be another moment for Christian Siriano ? Will she call on Jason Wu , a designer she’s worn on so many occasions? Whichever way she ends up going this evening, her latest look bodes well for what’s in store. 
Michelle Obama Takes A Bow 
As Michelle Obama tucks into velvety pasta pillows and beef tenderloin with her husband Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and various high-profile guests at Tuesday night’s state dinner, here’s a look back at some of her most memorable state dinner fashion . 
The first lady has hosted 14 state dinners in total, including India in 2009, Mexico in 2010, Korea in 2011 and the Nordic countries in May this year. 
Her most notable FLOTUS fashion statements include the amazing Vera Wang mermaid dress she wore for China’s state dinner in 2015 and the ivory column gown designed by Lady Gaga’s former stylist Brandon Maxwell that she debuted for dinner with Singapore’s Prime Minister earlier this summer. Public Image and Style 
With the ascent of her husband as a prominent national politician, Obama has become a part of popular culture. In May 2006, Essence listed her among “25 of the World’s Most Inspiring Women.” 
In July 2007, Vanity Fair listed her among “10 of the World’s Best Dressed People.” She was an honorary guest at Oprah Winfrey’s Legends Ball as a “young’un” paying tribute to the ‘Legends,’ who helped pave the way for African American women. 
In September 2007, 02138 magazine listed her 58th of ‘The Harvard 100’; a list of the prior year’s most influential Harvard alumni . Her husband was ranked fourth. In July 2008, she made a repeat appearance on the Vanity Fair international best dressed list. 
She also appeared on the 2008 People list of best-dressed women and was praised by the magazine for her “classic and confident” look.

                            [text] => Politics Ghana urged to raise women representation in politics Gender and political activists on Thursday called on political parties to give space to women to participate in the electoral process in Ghana. Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
Ekutu Aukot, a former chair of Selection Panel, Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission of Kenya, said Africans must create a contest that will allow women to participate in political office up to the highest office in the land. 
“Political contest is a male-dominated game so much so that when a woman wants to participate in politics, she meets disrespect. So the contest in which we operate is one thing that we must actually confront going forward,” he said. 
He was speaking at a policy dialogue on gender equal participation and leadership in politics and electoral process in Ghana, organized by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and its partners. 
The dialogue aims to deconstruct the role of political parties in promoting gender equal political participation and the role political parties can play in supporting women inclusion and participation in political processes at all levels. 
It offered an opportunity to political parties, practitioners and advocates to interact and begin a process of building common group on improving gender balance in Ghana politics. 
Recent political statistics show that Ghana currently ranks 150 out of 187 in the inter-parliamentary Union on women representation in parliament. 
In Ghana, only 29 legislatures out of the current 275 are women, a situation seen as a clear contradiction when one compares Ghana’s democratic standing with the rest of Africa. 
The Country Director of UNDP Dominic Sam called on Ghana to work towards ensuring that women are well represented in the political circles as leaders and decision-makers. 
He was optimistic that through the debate, participants will examine and gain a better understanding of the issues — the challenge faced by women in their efforts to access political opportunities in Ghana.

                            [text] => Health UN staff in Chad launch blood donation campaign UN staff working in Chad launched a blood donation campaign on Thursday in capital N'Djamena ahead of the United Nations Day to be celebrated on Oct. 24. Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
There are more than 140 UN staff in Chad who came to the clinic run by the institution 
The representative of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Chad, Jean-Marie Viany Yameogo, lamented the lack of culture to donate blood voluntarily by Africans. He urged to advocate mobilization campaigns to make people understand the meaning of blood donation. 
“In Africa, the demand for blood transfusion and blood product is very strong and domestic medical agencies are faced with finding enough blood,” said Yameogo. 
Hospitals of Chad lack enough blood. Yameogo said the demand of the precious liquid is much higher than supply and blood centers must meet the double challenges of providing hospitals with sufficient blood while ensuring its quality and safety. 
Chadina National Blood Transfusion Center was created in 1972. Today, the rate of voluntary donation is only 14 percent for N’Djamena, and 5 percent for the whole country.

                            [text] => Emerging Markets Tanzania to punish officials who sabotage state-run industries Tanzanian government on Thursday announced to take legal action against officials who claimed to have contributed to the collapse and bankruptcy of state-run industries. Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa said those behind the demise of the once giant state-run industries will be squarely dealt by the government. 
He cited the defunct state-run industries as Sungura, Kilitex, Mutex and the Southern Paper Mills, saying their collapse was masterminded by irresponsible and corrupt officials. 
“The country made fortunes from those factories but thanks to their dishonesty and corrupt minded schemes, such industries no longer exist. We will not allow that to happen in this era and those responsible will suffer the consequences,” the PM said in the northern Tanzanian city of Arusha when speaking at the sixth National Social Security Fund (NSSF) stakeholders’ meeting. 
His remarks came at the time when the east African nation had conceived the industrialization plan as the main catalyst to transform the economy, generate sustainable growth and reduce poverty.

The government has reviewed NACTEST to ensure a holistic approach to counter terrorism in the country, Babagana Monguno, National Security Adviser, said in Lagos, the nation’s economic hub at the opening of a two-day stakeholders’ workshop on the implementation of NACTEST. 
Monguno said a NACTEST desk would be inaugurated comprising officials of state and local governments as well as civil society organisations and community leaders from Lagos, Ogun and Oyo states. 
He said the establishment of the desk, which is in line with the reviewed NACTEST document would ensure quick and effective response to counter terrorism. 
Earlier, the governor of Lagos, Akinwunmi Ambode, promised to continue to extend the needed logistic support to all security agencies in the state. 
He appealed to the participants, especially security agencies, to always collaborate to enable the nation to win the war against terrorism and insecurity. Enditem

                            [text] => AMA exceeds revenue target from Gh¢10m to Gh¢40m Okoe Vanderpuije Raises AMA Revenue from Gh¢10m to Gh¢40m Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
The Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA) has tripped its revenue from Gh¢10 million to Gh¢40 million under the able leadership of the indefatigable Mayor of Accra, Dr. Alfred Okoe Vanderpuije. 
This unmatched feat was achieved after the Mayor, Dr. Alfred Okoe Vanderpuije tok over the management of the Assembly from 2009; implementing feasible steps in ensuring that more revue is generated by the Assembly to enable it implement more developmental projects within the region. 
It is an undeniable fact that the Mayor of Accra, who has achieved so much for the people of Ghana, placing Accra on a pedestal among cities of the world, has become a household name both home and abroad. 
In 2015, the Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA), exceeded its revenue target by four million Ghana Cedis, in 2014. 
In that year, the Assembly budgeted for 26 million Ghana Cedis and made 30 million Ghana Cedis through an intensive revenue mobilization drive implemented by the Mayor, to generate more funds to expand the scope of its development projects. 
Dr Alfred Oko Vanderpuije, the Accra Metropolitan Chief Executive, who is also the NDC Parliamentary candidate for Ablekuma South Constituency disclosed during his house-to-house campaign that in 2015, The Assembly had targeted 86 million Ghana Cedis for the Assembly to realize its vision of transforming the city and building more schools in the metropolis. 
Residents of Ablekuma South were thrown into wild jubilation when Dr. Alfred Okoe Vanderpuije broke the news of helping the Assembly to triple its revenue from Gh¢10 million to Gh¢40 million in 2016. 
He said, under his leadership the Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA) embarked on a rigorous revenue mobilisation drive with the projection to increase its revenue by 17.3 per cent in 2016. Dr Alfred Okoe Vanderpuije, said the achievement was as result of that vigorous revenue mobilisation campaigns the assembly had embarked upon since 2009 which had seen a revenue increase of more than 100 per cent. 
He told supporters that the AMA’s internally generated fund (IGF) in 2011 increased by GH¢20,323,193, representing 53.1 per cent, while in 2012, it increased by GH¢22,990,853.81, which represented 13.1 per cent. 
With respect to 2013, he indicated that revenue increased by GH¢25,100,000, representing 9.1 per cent, and in 2015 it recorded a GH¢32.145749.12 rise that represented 28 per cent. His revelation was greeted by loud applause and cheers from members of the constituency who were happy to hear that chunk of the revenue collected was ploughed into areas such as education, infrastructure, health, sanitation, agriculture, transportation, roads and the street-naming exercise. 
Dr Alfred Okoe Vanderpuije also told his people that the assembly had, beginning from February this year, pursued the prosecution of people who defaulted in their tax obligations in 2015, resulting in the great achievement and the unprecedented increase in revenue, first in the history of the AMA. 
He also indicated that, the claims by the opposition NPP that the NDC has done nothing for the communities cannot be accepted since, the AMA under his watch abolished the shift system in the 2010/2011 academic year, and had successfully completed and furnished 14 Millennium City Schools (MCSs) out of the 100 that were under construction as part of efforts to improve the quality of education in the country. 
The assembly, he stated, would inaugurate newly completed Millennium City Schools and also work on the construction of six new schools under the Urban Development Grant. He also pointed out that his tireless efforts to build a better city has placed Accra among thirty-five (35) Most Resilient Cities in the world, of which the Rockefeller Foundation awarded Accra $1,000,000 fund to assists the city to develop. 
Dr. Alfred Okoe Vanderpuije, this was not achieved overnight but through “leadership role and tireless efforts” he played in ensuring that Accra becomes a resilient one through innovations such as the Millennium City School project. 
He however disabused the minds of the people from the claims by the NPP and his opponent that the Rockefeller Foundation fund had been squandered on his campaign. According to him, Foundations like Rockefeller will not give out money to people who will have nothing better to do than to squander and that, the continuous project he is undertaking within the city has also won the admiration of Bloomberg Foundation. 
“This is great for us and for our nation,” he said. 
He promised that the City of Accra will continue to grow under his care even more as the MP for Ablekuma South. He appealed to the people to vote massively for him as the MP and for the NDC as the governing party in the coming election on December 7.

                            [text] => NDC Promises to Avail Mahama for EIB’s Presidential Debate Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
The campaign team of the National Democratic Congress says it will make President John Mahama available for a presidential debate proposal being spearheaded by the Excellence In Broadcasting network (EIB). 
National Coordinator for the NDC campaign Kofi Adams told Nii Arday Clegg on the Morning Starr Friday that the President will attend the EIB debate and hopes that his opponent Nana Akufo-Addo will show up too. 
“Your platform is so credible that if you submit the proposal for the debate, the campaign will consider it. And I can assure you that we are ready and the President will show up if EIB holds the debate…we will wait for you to present the proposal then we move it forward,” Adams told Arday Clegg. 
President Mahama who had turned down an IEA proposal for a debate between him and the opposition leader has over the past few weeks been pushing for a one-on-one challenge with the three-time flagbearer. 
He told the Volta Star in an interview Thursday that such a debate will him and Nana Addo to justify the claims they are both making on the performance of the economy. 
But the NPP has described the President’s call as hypocritical. They argue the President should have taken up the IEA debate request if he was interested in debating their candidate. 
Spokesperson for the NPP presidential candidate Mustapha Hammid told Arday Clegg that they are not ready to debate the president now since their focus is on the campaign.

                            [text] => News CADDP improving food and nutrition security-report says The Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) is having positive effects toward greater food and nutrition security in countries that have implemented the process Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
The Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) is having a positive impact on food and nutrition security in countries that are implementing it, according to the just released 2015 Annual Trends and Outlook Report (ATOR). 
The ATOR, was released yesterday by the Regional Strategic Analysis and Knowledge Support System (ReSAKSS), a program facilitated by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), during the opening of the 2016 ReSAKSS Annual Conference in Accra, organized by IFPRI in partnership with the African Union Commission. 
The 2015 ATOR examines the current status of nutrition in Africa, including progress in meeting the 2014 AU Malabo nutrition targets, and highlights the importance of dietary quality and diversity. It further stresses the importance of strengthening capacities for nutrition mainstreaming, monitoring and evaluation. 
It stated that, “Undernourishment is lowest among countries that have not yet adopted the CAADP process,” and that, “The rates of reduction in undernourishment are faster in CAADP countries especially those that have been in the process the longest and those that have gone through most of the stages of the process.” 
Officially opening the 2016 ReSAKSS annual conference, AUC Commissioner for Rural Economy and Agriculture, H.E Tumusiime Rhoda Peace, represented by Dr. Janet Edeme, Acting Director for the Department of Rural Economy and Agriculture (DREA), said achieving a nutrition revolution would require informed plans and investments coupled with leadership for effective implementation. 
“The complexity and multi-sectorality of nutrition demand for better coordination of interventions in order to make real and effective impact. By investing in a nutrition revolution, we are reducing malnutrition at all levels of the population including children and women, as spelt out in Africa’s Agenda 2063,” she said.

“Improving food security is not only about making sure people are consuming adequate calories, but ensuring that diets provide adequate nutrients for the healthy growth and development of Africa’s children and the health and wellbeing of all people,” said Ousmane Badiane, IFPRI Director for Africa. “This report shows that policymakers must not only monitor nutrition outcomes but set ambitious targets and design appropriate strategies to achieve these. The first step to reducing poverty and promoting economic growth in Africa is to reduce hunger and malnutrition which rob the continent of its human resource potential.” 
According to IFPRI, more key findings of the report include: 
Statistics and trends indicate a need for more concerted effort in tackling a triple burden of malnutrition in Africa that includes reducing under-nutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, and overweight and obesity. 
The potential nutritional impact of existing food policies (including agricultural subsidies) should be reviewed, and reforms should be initiated for those policies that are likely to have adverse effects on people’s dietary quality and body weight. 
Comprehensive monitoring and evaluation systems, complete with key nutrition indicators and contextualized evidence, are needed to evaluate the impact of comprehensive investment plans on nutrition and attainment of the international, continental, and national commitments for growth, development, and nutrition. 
Overall, the analysis of CAADP indicators shows that countries that have been in the CAADP process the longest and those that have gone through most of the levels of the CAADP process have tended to register better outcomes in most of the indicators reviewed, thus highlighting the positive impact of CAADP. 
It is essential to harness the potential for science, technology, and innovation to reduce postharvest losses and food waste; promote product diversification with nutritious foods; improve processing to extend shelf life and make healthy foods easier to prepare; and improve storage and preservation to retain nutritional value, ensure food safety, and extend seasonal availability.

The disqualified Presidential Nominee of the All People’s Congress (APC), Dr. Hassan Ayariga, has stated that his presidential ambition is on course despite efforts by the Electoral Commission (EC) to stop him. 
The chair of the election management body, Charlotte Osei, according to Ayariga is not “serious” for denying the whole country the opportunity to have him a presidential candidate. 
He would not have been worried if his disqualification was based on realities, he said. But, it was not, he added. 
He noted the contentious disqualification will not stop “Dr. Hassan Ayariga bid to become president of Ghana. He was only 44 years old,” he said, adding he has so many years to go until 72. 
The EC has disqualified 12 presidential aspirants including Mr. Ayariga over nomination form anomalies. 
The EC explained that it was unable to accept Mr Ayariga’s nomination because he did not “provide evidence on his statutory declaration as to his hometown or residence in the constituency as per the legal requirements,” an explanation Mr. Ayariga labeled as “big lie.” 
According to him, his disqualification is part of a grand plot to thwart his bid to become the country’s president.

                            [text] => Common pitfalls when valuing property Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
For some firms, being awarded an instruction to value a property or portfolio of real estate assets is often not given sufficient regard, says TC Chetty, country manager for South Africa for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). 
“While new business is always welcome, new business is not necessarily ‘good’ business if insufficient attention is paid to actual qualification and competence, and this puts any valuer in a potentially risky situation. 
“When cash flow is tight, there may be pressure to accept any valuation instruction, which may lead to firms accepting instructions where they are unable to demonstrate detailed sector knowledge or where they don’t have the correct specialist skills.” 
In South Africa, all practicing valuers must be registered with the South African Council for the Property Valuers Profession. 
Graham Stockey, principal assurance surveyor, Regulation for RICS, explains further: “This includes a range of scenarios such as practitioners from a non-valuation discipline carrying out valuation instructions without the necessary training or experience, a valuer accepting instructions in a country or location where they do not possess the required detailed knowledge of the local market, or where a valuer who only has experience of valuing residential property is asked to provide a valuation report on a huge property portfolio which spans many locations and includes hotels and commercial and industrial property. 
“If you were a client in the latter instance, you would not be happy to know that your valuer didn’t have much experience on mixed use and commercial property.” 
Stockey says when undertaking a valuation the Terms of Engagement document between client and valuer is the most important in a case file. This document details the responsibilities and the scope of work required. 
“Practitioners can often leave out essential basics which we categorise as ‘who am I’? This includes qualifications, competence and status. Who is my client and other intended users, and why do they want the valuation? After that, really poor terms of reference may fail to include the four key pillars, namely address/ type of property/ user/interest to be valued, the valuation date, basis of value and special assumptions. 
“When large sums of money are involved, it is critically important that valuers set out limitations of their due diligence. This is particularly important for the purposes of professional indemnity insurance and relates to limitations to inspections and investigations, assumptions and the source of all information and reliability.” 
He says a good Terms of Engagement document should also include general declarations about publication and sharing, third party reliability, compliance with International Valuation Standards (IVS) or ‘Red Book’ and any other regulation or legislation. It should also include a complaints handling procedure statement confirming that the valuation report has been produced in accordance with IVS and RICS Valuation Professional Standards, and the fee or how the fee will be calculated.” 
Avoid conflict of interest 
Stockey also points out that a conflict of interest may arise and is anything that impedes or might be perceived to impede an individual’s or firm’s ability to act impartially and in the best interest of a client. A conflict of interest can cast doubt on a valuer’s integrity and can also have a damaging effect on his or her firm and the profession as a whole. 
“RICS requires valuers to act independently and objectively and without conflicts of interest. 
“Valuers must make a file note of all checks carried out into previous involvement with any aspect of the valuation instruction, including all parties to the property transaction, the property itself and any cross-discipline connection they may have with parties involved in the transaction.” 
He says acting when a clear conflict of interest exists – and not declaring it to clients is unacceptable for a valuer and does not comply with RICS Rules of Conduct or Red Book requirements. Where a conflict, or potential conflict is identified, not giving due consideration as to whether the instruction should be accepted or declined is also not acceptable. 
“Results of any conflict of interest check should always be recorded as this is the valuer’s only way to demonstrate having confirmed his or her independence prior to commencing with the task. Failure to clearly define and record steps taken to manage a potential conflict in the case file, Terms of Engagement and the report is where valuers can fall down. 
“Equally, if not more important for a valuer is to maintain a record of any discussions, e-mails, or letters relating to the management of any potential conflict of interest. Otherwise, how can you later prove you informed your client if that person chooses to challenge you?” concludes Stockey.

                            [text] => South Africa begins process to withdraw from ICC S. Africa begins process to withdraw from ICC: justice minister Oct 21, 2016 
South Africa has begun the process of withdrawing from the International Criminal Court (ICC), Minister of Justice and Correctional Services Michael Masutha confirmed on Friday. 
International Criminal Court (ICC) Written notice has been submitted to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, and withdrawal will take effect one year after the secretary general receives notification, Masutha told a press briefing in Pretoria. 
South Africa is hindered by the Rome Statute under which the ICC was established, Mashutha explained, adding that the Rome Statute compels the country to arrest people who may enjoy diplomatic immunity but who are wanted by the ICC. Enditem

                            [text] => Letting Kogi State Governor work in peace-Odemegwu writes Kogi Politicians Should Let Gov. Bello Be Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
The Executive Governor of Kogi State, Alhaji Yahaya Bello may be in for another set of distraction after the Supreme Court on September 20 2016 upheld his election as the rightful winner of the gubernatorial election in the state held in 2015. It is perceived that some politicians in the state are working round the clock in making sure that the governor suffers a setback in his administration. 
Recently, they accused the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) of keeping eyes right in their call to investigate Bello for whatever reason Nigerians are yet to know. This was coming after they had written series of petition to the body. But the EFCC seemed to know better – that there might be the hand of Jacob but the voice of Esau in their petition – making their petition null and void. 
The other time, there were speculations that he was pelted with pure water sachet while coming out from the Mosque, after a day’s prayer. If true that he was pelted, political observers know who to hold responsible. And if he was not pelted, the same people know who to hold responsible for circulating the message of defame. 
Most politicians hire crowd for an event, the same way they hire street urchins to cast aspersion before the public, on the personality of their prey. However, Nigerians of good will cannot sit down and watch Alhaji Yahaya Bello, the young and youthful Governor of Kogi State be brought to disrepute. We are yet to read that he associates with mischief, except as some politicians in that state want us to believe. 
Unlike some persons who allow some heights they have attained in life to influence and control them, the last time we checked, Bello still respects elders and is ever ready to learn from people. While he is doing his best to bring any person or group that has been politically squabbling to make peace with each other, some of the politicians are throwing tantrums. Sad! 
No matter what they might be doing to plunge Bello into the murky waters of disgrace, the governor seems not perturbed as he goes about his official duties to uplift Kogi State, putting much effort on rural and urban development. He believes that after developing this area, it will attract a lot of potentials. 
With his New Direction Blueprint, the governor has vowed to take education to the next level in the state. Any doubting Thomas may ask the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Petra Onyegbule. With the state’s rich mineral and natural resources, although many are yet to be tapped, Bello has said he has the youths at heart in his development priorities. 
While working to raise these youths, the governor has reiterated the need for technical education while people are pursuing the secular education. Nonetheless, many Nigerians might be crying over the lame-duck governance of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at the federal level, but Bello has shown that he has a New Direction Blueprint: A promise he made when he went to pick Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms of the APC in company of chieftains of the party from the three senatorial zones in the state. 
Governor Bello pledged to overturn the high level of crimes in the state. The party leaders conversely knew that he would not disappoint in carrying out his official functions when they stopped the thought of any other candidate as the party’s typical bearer. The unwavering Bello filled out the form, signed by a Commissioner of Oath, and returned to the APC National Secretariat, in what political pundits said was affixed to a letter of nomination sent to INEC on Friday November 27 2015, by the National Chairman of APC, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun. 
The party perhaps knew that Mr. James Abiodun Faleke might not do better than Bello, hence Falake was asked to be Bello’s running mate. But Faleke refused that offer and insisted on Abubakar Audu/Faleke ticket, which the party gave the duo before Audu suddenly died on November 22, 2015. It will be pertinent to say that with the aggressive policking against Bello in Kogi, if the state fails, it will concern everybody in the state. But it will not fail with Bello! 
So, Governor Yahaya Bello should be left without distractions to earnestly fix the state to attain his dream state, where there will no longer be pot holes in front of the Government House, educational system will never be horrible again, Kogi children will not be taught under the trees, teachers will not be discouraged; the potentialities of the agriculture sector will not be undiscovered, and infrastructure will not be in totters.

                            [text] => Caroline Manzo Says She Likes Reality TV Than All Rhonj Caroline Manzo: “Realiy TV is My Job, Nothing More!” Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
In an exclusive interview with In Touch magazine, Caroline Manzo shares her true feelings about reality TV and fame — including how she is doing post-Real Housewives of New Jersey. 
“Fame is nonsense,” she tells In Touch. “The minute it starts affecting your life in a negative way, you have to walk away.” 
“The reality TV thing is my job, nothing more,” insists the 55-year-old mom of three (Albie, 30, Lauren, 28, and Chris, 27) with her husband of 32 years, Al, 56. “You can’t let fame go to your head, and you can never forget where you came from.” 
“I’m just a regular mom from New Jersey,” she says. “The person you see on television is the person you’re going to meet face to face.” 
Post-RHONJ, she says is “very happy now” and says she is having a great time filming her new show with her family. “I love doing Manzo’d. It’s a completely different animal,” she says. “It’s a lighter feeling.” Do you have more to share about this story - photos or video etc - you can send them to: (newsghana101@gmail.com) TAGS

                            [text] => CEOs Urged To Have Digital Strategies Every Business Needs A Digital Strategy-MTN CEO Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
Ebenezer Twum Asante, the CEO of MTN has urged all businesses to search and tap into the digital opportunities that abound, irrespective of one’s industry. He said, looking at the way businesses are rapidly shifting from the physical interaction to a more digital space, businesses without digital strategies would have a hard time connecting with consumers. 
Mr. Asante was engaging members of the Chartered Institute of Marketing Ghana (CIMG), as part of CIMG’s annual strategy to enable members engage industry leaders. He spoke on the theme Digital Lifestyle & Mobile Financial Services: Inclusiveness, Trends & Opportunities. He said, “You do not need to be a digital business to have a digital strategy”. “So long as your customers are going more and more digital, it is not only about communication, advertising or product visibility in the digital environment, but it is also about how you re-model your own business to take advantage of this trend.” 
The Africa consumer is more mobile ready now than ever and consumers are leapfrogging landline infrastructure and jumping straight into digital mobile technology. This fast growth in internet penetration is in tandem with the growing spate of Mobile Money subscription. Thus the best way to monetise digital business innovations is through Mobile Financial Services. 
“The debit and credit card penetration in Ghana is very marginal,” he said. “So if you manage to pull up a wonderful digital strategy, the best way to monetise it is mainly through Mobile Financial Service.” 
Following the introduction of the MTN Mobile Money Service in Ghana in 2009, the subscriber base has grown to approximately 7.8 million registered customers, with over 48,000 Mobile Money agents performing over 40 million transactions monthly across the country. 
Also, in line with the EMI Guidelines issued by the Bank of Ghana in July 2015, MTN made a total payment of GH₵ 13.4million in interest to over 6.2 million Mobile Money customers in September. MTN Mobile Money continues to partner financial institutions and other values to deliver the best value propositions to customers. One of such is the TBILL4ALL service launched recently in partnership with Ecobank.

                            [text] => Doctor reveals prostate cancer death has increased in Nigeria 26 men die daily of Prostate Cancer in Nigeria… Men’s Health Charity to intervene—Prof. Obu Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
Founder and President of Men’s Health Foundation (MHF)- Ghana & Nigeria, Professor Dr. Raphael Nyarkotey Obu, has revealed that twenty six (26) Nigerian men die daily of prostate cancer. 
According to him, the rate at which men diagnosed with prostate cancer die in Nigeria was very alarming. 
Prof. Nyarkotey Obu, who is a prostate cancer researcher and a policy maker, made the revelation. 
He said what was even more worrying about the Nigeria problem was the fact that awareness level of the disease (prostate cancer) was very low. 
“In fact there is little awareness of prostate cancer in Nigeria compared to the kind of publicity my NGO-Men’s Health Foundation-has created in Ghana,” Prof. Nyarkotey Obu disclosed. 
The low awareness of prostate cancer in Nigeria, Prof. Nyarkotey Obu, disclosed has compelled his non-governmental organisation (MHF) to spread it wings into Nigeria and help prevent more prostate cancer deaths. 
“…In fact the rate at which men diagnosed with prostate cancer die in Nigeria is very alarming, and that is why MHF has formed the Nigerian branch. And through our Nigerian branch we aim to create awareness on the disease in all the States of Nigeria and also help prevent prostate cancer deaths in Nigeria,” Prof. Nyarkotey Obu emphasised. 
The prostate cancer researcher further hinted that his NGO will also lobby the powers-that-be in Nigeria and push for Father’s Day to be recognised as National Prostate Cancer Day in Nigeria “like we are hoping to achieve in Ghana.” According to Prof. Nyarkotey Obu, the launch of the Men’s Health Foundation Nigeria will come off on November 15, 2016 in Lagos. 
The Coordinator of MHF-Nigeria, Samuel Larbi Ariyo, who was with Prof. Nyarkotey Obu, disclosed that since his branch was making inroads after a month’s of being in operation. 
“…More prominent Nigerians including politicians, government officials have expressed interest in the project and are willing to support the NGO,” he noted. 
He went on to reveal that the Nigerian branch of Men’s Health Foundation has an 8-member committee which is headed by Mr. Samuel Babalola. 
“For now what we are basically doing is that we are feverishly preparing towards the official launch of the Nigerian branch of Men’s Health Foundation in Lagos which is slated for November 15, 2016,” Mr. Ariyo averred. 
According to Dr. Raphael Nyarkotey Obu who is a research Professor of Prostate cancer & Holistic Medicine at Da Vinci College of Holistic Medicine, Cyprus further revealed that, Prostate cancer is the number one cancer killer of Nigerian men! In Nigeria, prostate cancer has a mortality rate of over eighty percent (80%)! A recent report by World Health Organization (WHO) shows that within a period of four years, deaths from prostate cancer in Nigeria increased by almost 100 per cent. The report showed that Prostate cancer now kills 26 Nigerian men every day (up from 14 men every day). 
This increase is evident from frequent reports in the media of prominent Nigerians that have died of the disease in recent times out of ignorance. The Nigerian prostate cancer statistics is alarming and outrageous, given the fact that prostate cancer is curable if detected early. He added. 
Explaining What is responsible for the high mortality rate of prostate cancer in Nigeria and the black community, he explained that the answer is not far -fetched- lack of awareness and inadequate infrastructure and manpower for cancer prevention and treatment in Nigeria. We have relied too much on foreign research which is not beneficial because there is cancer disparity and until black scientist, Physicians, government, policy makers and researchers rise up we are unlikely to see any further headway. To improve prostate cancer survivor ship, it is important for every man to know his risk of prostate cancer as well as the signs and symptoms. 
We will work with policy makers and other organizations to improve services delivery. We will research into the disease locally, provide support to those diagnosed, and provide training to health professionals and research into evidence based holistic medicine to address the side effect of conventional treatment. 
There is urgent need to make prostate cancer screening widely available and accessible to all Nigerian men. He says “We cannot treat our way out of the prostate cancer problem. We need commitment to prevention and early detection is desperately needed in order to complement improved treatments and address the alarming rise in prostate cancer burden in the black community, the mortality rate is very high in Nigeria, for every six men diagnosed 5 will die leaving only one and it appears prostate cancer is a death sentence in Nigeria. He says. 
On moving forward Dr. Nyarkotey says, “An excellent way of providing easily accessible prostate cancer screenings would be the deployment of Mobile Cancer Centres (MCC) which would take holistic health promotion to the grassroots of Nigeria and we have a plan in Nigeria as we expand our wings and services to other African countries to stop prostate cancer before it strikes as ignoring prostate cancer wont beat it. He concluded.

                            [text] => Dawn Of A New Day In Ghana It Is a Crispy New Day in Ghana Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
I knew right away, when the penis-chomping incident involving Techiman Municipal Fire Commander Eric Philip Ansah and the young woman whom the alleged victim described as his girlfriend hit the media headlines, that somebody was not tell us the truth. 
Now, as the Daily Guide tells it, it turns out that the woman who mustered the laudable courage to put Mr. Ansah on sharp notice that sexual harassment will no longer be tolerated in the Ghana Fire Service, in particular, but also Ghanaian society in general, had been persistently and consistently harassed for the four months that she had been working at the Techiman Fire Station as a janitor or cleaner. As of this writing, Ms. Ataa Takyi, whose age had not been given to the public by law-enforcement officers, was on bail while police investigators determined the merits of the case. 
Commander Ansah has also been granted a bail bond in the sum of GH₵ 2,000, while he recovers from his penile wounds and awaits the possibility of a formal indictment and trial, as well as the possibility of permanent severance from his post. So far, though, both parties have been charged with rape, in the case of Mr. Ansah, and causing deliberate harm, in the case of Mr. Takyi (See “Fire Chief Fondled My Breasts – Ataa Takyi” Ghanaweb.com 10/15/16). Indeed, Commander Ansah dug himself into a deep criminal culpability hole, when he told police investigators that he had had sexual intercourse with his collegial subordinate at least four times in the past four months. 
Now, four coituses in four months readily exposes Ms. Takyi’s workplace superior as the patent liar here; for about the only way that a supposedly loving couple would have had only four sexual encounters in four months would be in a case where one of the couples, or either one of them, had been away from the other in long intermittent spells. The other possibility would, of course, be in a situation where at least one of the couples was estranged from the other. In this case, it is readily obvious that the real victim here is Ms. Takyi who tells the Daily Guide that when she met Commander Ansah at the Techiman Fire Station, she was already in a serious and loving relationship with another man who had promised to marry her. 
Couple the preceding with the fact that it was the alleged culprit, Commander Ansah, who had reportedly forcibly invited himself into the bedroom of Ms. Takyi, and it becomes inescapably glaring that, indeed, it was Mr. Ansah who had invited trouble into his apparently hitherto uneventful existence. Now, what I am not hearing and/or reading enough about are the pontifical voices of those politically heavyweight legally trained rights activist women who promptly went to bat for the members of the infamous Montie-Three Gang, who threatened to sexually violate Chief Justice Georgina Theodora Wood, if the CJ and her Supreme Court associates did not turn a blind eye to widely perceived attempts by the Electoral Commission (EC) to rig Election 2016 in favor of the Mahama regime. 
Well, I am making this observation because it is all too evident that rather than being gratuitously charged for causing serious bodily harm to her repeat rapist and would-be rapist, in the latest incident or instance, Commander Ansah’s victim ought to be rather commended and possibly conferred with a state honor to serve as an emulative example for other young women excruciatingly caught in a similar vulnerable situation, on how to take charge and jealously guard and protect the integrity and chastity of their own bodies from unwanted male predators. It is also time for the Donald Trumps of Ghana to responsibly own up to their pathological sexual perversion, promptly seek psychological counseling and comprehensive therapy to help them straighten up their predatory and misogynistic ways and/or tendencies.

                            [text] => EU Bank Opens In Cameroon EU bank opens regional office for Central Africa in Cameroon Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
The European Investment Bank (EIB), the bank of the European Union, today announced the opening of a representational office that will act as a hub for investment projects in the Central African region. 
At a ceremony held earlier today the European Investment Bank, Europe’s long-term lending institution, formally opened a permanent regional representation office in Yaoundé, Cameroon. The new office will lead the engagement of the EIB, the world’s largest international public bank, in terms of supporting the development of long-term public and private sector investment in the region in partnership with the EU and managing relations with the national and regional authorities, as well as with the other international organisations based in the Cameroonian capital. 
“The European Investment Bank has a strong track record in supporting crucial investment programmes across Africa and around the world. The opening of an office for the Central Africa region will help us to support crucial investment in infrastructure, water, energy and other key sectors, as well as backing private sector growth, essential for economic development. This is the fifth EIB office in Sub-Saharan Africa, which underlines once more the commitment of the EU bank towards the region, as well as the importance of Cameroon as a central hub in this area. We wish to thank the Cameroonian authorities and our European Delegation colleagues for their invaluable support in creating this office.” said Pim van Ballekom, European Investment Bank Vice-President. 
“The European Investment Bank is the European Union’s bank and the new Yaoundé office will strengthen European support for crucial investment across Cameroon and the Central Africa region in the years to come.” said Ambassador Francoise Collet, Head of the European Union Delegation to Cameroon. 
The official opening was welcomed by several Ministers of the Cameroonian government. Ambassadors from across Africa and Europe, representatives of other international finance organisations and the business community were also present. 
The EIB has supported investment in Cameroon since 1965 and last year it provided more than EUR 850 million for investment across Africa. The Bank also introduced Andrea Pinna as head of the new office in Yaoundé. Mr Pinna has many years of professional experience in development banking in projects outside Europe.

                            [text] => Inside Africa UN Expert Launches in Madagascar on Fact-Finding Mission Human rights and the environment: UN expert launches first fact-finding visit to Madagascar During his seven-day visit, at the invitation of the Government, the human rights expert will meet Government officials and experts, as well as representatives of civil society Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
A healthy environment is essential for the enjoyment of human rights everywhere, but it is of the utmost importance for the protection of human rights in Madagascar. 
The United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights and the environment, John H. Knox, will undertake his first official visit to Madagascar from 25 to 31 October 2016 to assess how the country is protecting and promoting human rights relating to environmental protection. 
“A healthy environment is essential for the enjoyment of human rights everywhere, but it is of the utmost importance for the protection of human rights in Madagascar, where so much of the population is rural and depends directly on the environment,” the expert stressed. 
“I am looking forward to the visit to Madagascar as a treasure house of ecological diversity, and because it will help to inform my understanding of the relationship of the conservation of biological diversity and the protection of human rights,” said Mr. Knox, who is currently working on a year-long study* on biodiversity and human rights. 
The Special Rapporteur noted that the Government of Madagascar has made important commitments to protect human rights related to the environment. Its Environmental Charter states that everyone has the fundamental right to live in a healthy and balanced environment, and specifically recognizes several rights such as rights to information, participation and access to justice as well as the impacts that environmental harm can have on social and economic aspects of life. 
“I will assess, in particular, the lessons learned and challenges faced in the country with regard to realisation of environmental rights, as well as how it is addressing environmental challenges with human rights impacts such as climate change, deforestation, and the loss of biological diversity,” he said. 
During his seven-day visit, at the invitation of the Government, the human rights expert will meet Government officials and experts, as well as representatives of civil society. 
Mr. Knox will present his preliminary observations on the visit at a press conference on the last day of the mission, Monday 31 October at 11:30, in Salle de réunion Titan II, Maison Commune des Nations Unies, Zone Galaxy, Rue du Dr Raseta, Andraharo, Antananarivo 101. Access to the press conference is strictly limited to journalists. 
The Special Rapporteur will present a comprehensive report to the UN Human Rights Council in 2017.

                            [text] => Ghandi Statue Removal: Francis Kwarteng writes to Okoampa The Gandhi Statue Removal Petition Had Nothing To Do With J.B. Danquah 2 Oct 21, 2016 
“I have learned to hate all traitors, and there is no disease that I spit on more than treachery” (Aeschylus). 
CONTRADICTION OF THE CENURY: AFROCENTRIC DANQUAH VERSUS KWAME OKOAMPA-AHOOFE, AN UNABASHED DEFENDER OF AFROCENTRISTS 
Perhaps the most laughable—if not comical—aspect of journalist Kwame Okoampa-Ahoofe is the Afrocentric label he attaches to Danquah. In fact on Ghanaweb and other web portals he wrote a two-part article, titled “Boko Haram Scholars and King Kongi,” a direct titular reference to Afrocentric philosophers, scholars and writers. Today, thanks to this same yellow journalist called Kwame Okoampa-Ahoofe, Danquah now qualifies to wear the “Boko Haram—King Kongi Scholar” mortarboard! 
Why has it taken this yellow journalist this long to come to this conclusion about Danquah? How can a “Boko Haram—King Kongi Scholar” become an “acclaimed philosopher”? 
While he appears on Ghanaweb and other web portals with poorly written articles, from the point of view of the low quality research foundation of his write-ups, to miseducate and deceive his unsuspecting readership, Kwame Okoampa-Ahoofe does not tell this readership, that, the Theory of Afrocentricity and Afrocentric scholars played an important role in his graduate education as well as in his doctoral dissertation, which he titled “Atumpan: A Critical Analysis Of Twentieth-Century Ghanaian Anglophone Poetry (1998).” 
KWAME OKOAMPA-AHOOFE IN DEFENSE OF THE THEORY OF AFROCENTRICITY, OF AFROCENTRISTS 
What is more, his New York Times article (1999) “When Human Dignity is Besieged: An Afrocentric Critique of the Diary of Anne Frank” is, ironically, itself based on the Theory of Afrocentricity as is implied in the title (this article appeared on the Letters Column of the New York Times). Moreover, he would author a couple or so articles and hand them to academics—editors he now calls “Boko Haram—King Kongi Scholars” for them to be published in an Afrocentric peer-reviewed journal, the Journal of Black Studies, co-founded by Molefi Kete Asante! 
Then also he would author a whole book “The New Scapegoats: Colored-On-Black Racism” to critique Henry Louis Gates, Jr., the Harvard-based anti-Afrocentric scholar. Here is just one way Kwame Okoampa-Ahoofe went on the attack in defense of Afrocentric scholars and of the Theory of Afrocentricity (our emphasis): 
“In fact, he [Henry Louis Gates, Jr.] unabashedly called himself a cultural and genetic hybrid. He also routinely made vitriolic remarks against the Afrocentrists, and, in fact, it was hybrid intellectuals like Skip Gates who convinced some right-wing White-Americans to equate the Theory of Afrocentricity with Minister Louis Farrakhan’s branch of the Nation of Islam. 
“During the 1980s and 1990s, for instance, Gates snobbishly portrayed the Afrocentrists, particularly the Temple University School spear-headed by Molefi Kete Asante, as a band of pseudo-scholars and pharaoh’s of a patently fabricated ancient African civilization.” 
Elsewhere he dismissively referred to Gates as “A Feeding Bottle Theorist” and “Mainstream America’s Sonny Liston.” Significantly, Gates American Book Award-winning text (1989) “The Signifying Monkey: A Theory of African-American Literary Criticism,” perhaps his well-known work among literary scholars, borrowed heavily from the Theory of Afrocentricity and the work of Molefi Kete Asante in particular (see Wahneema Lubiano’s paper “Henry Louis Gates, Jr. And African-American Literary Discourse” in “Black Literature Criticism Supplement.” Eds: Jerry Moore & Jefrrey Hunter”). 
In fact Gates’ blurb praise for Asante’s influential text—“The Afrocentric Idea”—went as follows: 
“Asante’s wide range of references, his delightful examples taken from black traditions, and his sheer pleasure at discussing black culture, all combine to make his argument both cogent and important. This will be a major book.” 
In other words, Asante’s Theory of Afrocentricity which borrows from Nkrumah’s own work contributed to Gates’ influence today, as exemplified by his influential text “The Signifying Monkey.” The Theory of Afrocentricity is one of the most influential theories in the world today. Yet, Gates, like Molefi Kete Asante, represents one of the heavyweights in the American Academy! Nobody knows Kwame Okoampa-Ahoofe as he occupies the neglected periphery even of the Ghanaian Academy! His popularity is being the “Putative Doyen Of Ghanaweb Yellow Journalists”! 
Today, the Theory of Afrocentrity has permeated the American Academy and society in a way no one seemed to have anticipated. Asian scholars are borrowing ideas from the theory just as feminist studies have done. It is even a global phenomenon. Moreover, Gates (and his scholarship), like Kwame Anthony Appiah (and his scholarship), are widely known around the world for their scholarship, while the largely self-published works of some of our unproductive pseudo-scholar journalists are completely ignored in any serious academy because they lack value. 
On the other hand Dr. Dompere, one of the leading Nkrumah scholars in the world and the American Academy, is ranked among the “World’s Top 100 Leading Thinkers” while Molefi Kete Asante, the world’s leading Afrocentric theorist and an Nkrumah scholar himself, has also been ranked among the “100 Leading Thinkers in America.” These are the kind of academics and thinkers whose ideas are moving the world. 
It is partly the works and ideas of Nkrumah that have propelled the likes of Dompere and Asante onto the world stage! The journalist Kwame Okoampa-Ahoofe’s own works have benefited from the Theory of Afrocentricity. 
The insults Kwame Okoampa-Ahoofe showered on Gates are the same insults he is now showering on Afrocentrists today. On Ghanaweb he has turned himself into another Gates, an unabashed enemy of Afrocentrists and of the Theory of Afrocentricity. One has to be seriously sick in the head, to be schizophrenic for that matter, to insult Afrocentric scholars and academics and the Theory of Afrocentricity, only to turn around and appropriate the Afrocentric title for one’s idol. 
Since when did it become useful, even fashionable, to appropriate the word “Afrocentric” for J.B. Danquah? Doesn’t that make Danquah a “Boko Haram—King Kongi Scholar”? 
It is sad, even regrettable that while Afocentrists approach race relations, the sociology of knowledge, history and morality, human psychology, and the like from an essentialist viewpoint and methodology, others employ similar—if not the same—tools of essentialism to promote bigotry, ethnocentrism, hatred, ethnic hatred, and poor journalism. This is not what progressive African-centeredness is about! 
THE FOUNDING OF THE UNIVERSITY OF GHANA 
As for your reactionary Prof. Robert Addo-Fening the less said about him and his revisionist history, the better. His writing on the subject never even bother to detail the yeoman’s job Joseph Ephraim Casely Hayford (Ekra-Agiman) Hayford, one of J.B. Danquah’s foremost mentors and teachers, and other West Africans from the Sierra Leonean Dr. Africanus Horton (1835-1883)…I have written about this before. Here: 
“In 1911, Casely-Hayford took up Dr. Africanus Horton’s proposals for a West African University, and rather campaigned for a university for the Gold Coast. Nine years later, the National Congress of British West Africa, led by Casely-Hayford, petitioned the British Government ‘to found a British West African University on such lines as would preserve in the students a sense of African nationality… 
“This request yielded no positive response until 1945, when the Colonial Government finally embraced the idea of a university for the Gold Coast. This change of attitude was based on two separate reports submitted to the Colonial Government by Asquith and Elliot Commissions. Contained in the reports, the mission of the university was to train a new platonic African elite… 
“Importantly, the National Congress of British West Africa (NCBWA) was founded by JE Casely-Hayford, Kobina Sekyi, A. Sawyer, Thomas Hutton-Mills, Sr., A.B. Quartey-Papafio, Edward F. Small, Henry van Hien, and F.V. Nanka-Bruce. Admittedly, J.E. Casely-Hayford did the groundwork for the establishment of a university in the then-Gold Coast. Of course, Dr. JB Danquah did his part, though tangentially, and, as a result, as history consciously and eloquently informs the world, the seminal idea of establishing such a university in the then-Gold Coast was certainly not Danquah’s. 
“Particularly, this view is not debatable because of an obscure historical link between the two, Casely-Hayford and Danquah, with a palpable degree of overbearing tutelage which the former dutifully exerted on the latter, a political neophyte at that! Nana Ofori Atta Ayim writes of this obscure relationship: 
“‘Dr. Danquah was a protégé of the celebrated and iconic God-father of West African nationalism and the pioneer Pan-Africanist, Joseph Ephraim Casely-Hayford. In his own words, it was at the feet of the eminent nationalist, ‘Ekra Agyemang…’” 
In other words, it was through his association with Casely-Hayford that Danquah learned about the former’s (and his colleagues’) exploits in having a university in the West African sub-region, although Casely-Hayford “rather campaigned for a university for the Gold Coast.” This piece of important history is largely missing from Prof. Robert Addo-Fening’s writings on the subject. 
Importantly, then, there were so many ideas Danquah picked up from Casely-Hayford and the other Fante leaders, ideas that brought him into political and philosophical maturity, yet a topic we will not get into! They have been extensively covered in many scholarly works. At the end of the day it was the government of Nkrumah that built the University of Ghana, as Danquah was never a member of this government! 
CONCLUSION: THE NATURE OF THE CONTROVERSY 
Of course, Danquah did go to London at the head of a delegation on the later University of Ghana question. The question then becomes: What role did the other members of this delegation play? 
Yes, when it is about those who fought for Ghana’s independence journalists such Kwame Okoampa-Ahoofe wants Danquah to have a share in that glory. 
But when it comes to whose yeomanly struggles would eventually lay the foundation for the establishment of the University of Ghana, the likes of J.E. Casely-Hayford, Africanus Hortons…and several others are totally excluded from the scholarship! 
In this context, Prof. Addo-Fening’s writings on the subject are not authoritative as they ignore this essential part of the long history of the University of Ghana coming into being. 
FOOD FOR THOUGHT 
There are those whose writings rather than adding to the body of knowledge, subtracts from the body of knowledge. Their ethnocentric agitprop writings do not advance nation-building, the scientific and humanistic development of society, and refinement of the mind. 
Such impulsive, reactionary writings with their ideological bankruptcies potentially threaten the very foundation and survival of the human race, worsen the human condition, and starve impressionable minds of quality education. 
The idea of critical, analytic and scientific intellection and mentation is foreign to them, as it were beyond their reach because they have allowed hatred, ethnocentrism and bigotry to invade their value judgments, to cloud their sense of social justice, and to impair their sense of intellectual honesty. 
That is primary why their body of work has no instrumentalist value in the contemporary history of ideas, as well as lacking operational usefulness for development economics, ethnic relations, and development sociology. 
Such agitprop schizophrenics with their sensational revisionisms have no place in the modern academy of the twenty-first century, given that their corpus of writings can best be described as a potboiler and given that they primarily write not to educate and inform but rather to feed and satiate their egoistical tomfoolery and low self-esteem. They write to impoverish impressionable minds for the most part. 
These writers and journalists find comfort in the excruciating hyperbole of auctorial intemperance and self-worth only in exaggerated verbiage while progressive, scientific, analytic and critical informational content escape their potboiler writings. On this basis of this fact their ideas are stuck in the stone-age of intellectual backwardness, while their intellectually productive colleagues take them for mere dinosaurs in the history of ideas. 
Ghana deserves better. Africa deserves. We can do better for Ghana and Africa if we encourage men and women of great ideas, of refined temperaments, of patriotic vision, and of scientific bearings to take charge of affairs. Again, while the Chinese are working on putting man on the moon six years from now, we are fighting over each other by way of excessive adjectivization of partisan politics and historical revisionism and of overexploitation of split infinitives without regard for the analytic content of technocratic—scientific and technological, or industrial—vision! 
Furthermore, writing and reviewing books for the Amsterdam News and having a couple of articles published in peer-reviewed journals, for instance, does not put one in the same class of great writers from Toni Morrison, Derek Walcott, Doris Lessing, J.M. Coetzee, Pearl Buck, James Hemmingway, Nadine Gordimer, Gabriel Garcia, Ben Okri, Orhan Pamuk, Naguib Mahfouz, William Faulkner, Buchi Emecheta, and Leo Tolstoy to Wole Soyinka (Note: We have friends who work for are associated with the Amsterdam News in various capacities)! 
For far too long, we have allowed unabashed demagogues to define and adulterate the language of political and moral discourse. 
We shall return with Part 3!

Ghana is not among the most popular destination to set up business. The few entrepreneurs and investors we have had were attracted to the country due to it’s natural resources as well as the fact that English is the language of the Ghanaian business world. 
Governments for decades have not had great and attractive investment policies and guidelines to support and entice investors; both local and foreign. 
I won’t minced words on the industrious and well- educated workforce who now have turned useless and unemployed in the name of politricks and some nasty IMF bailout programme. 
With or without a Business degree or Business education background, most Ghanaians are naturally born “Business genius”. We are proud as Ghanaians and our pride extends to the nations natural resources which are the country’s main exports. 
What happens to our gold, oil, cocoa, beans, cashews, corn, plantain, cassava, timber, Aluminum, Manganese ore, diamonds and the horticultures? 
Where are the factories and the jobs..? 
In relation to ease of doing business, the country is now ranked 114th out of 189 countries included the World Banks Ease of doing business survey. 
Ghana imports mostly consumer goods and foodstuffs and yet the country’s economy is predominantly agricultural, with 60% of the population engaged in subsistence agriculture. And this is really sad . 
In 2013, the Bank of Ghana reported; the country imports estimated at $4515.06 million which was all time high with exports estimated at $2931.7 million in July 2013. In 2014, the dollar started swallowing the cedi and thereafter frightened lots of businesses so importation declined to $3413.22 million with $3583.4 million of exports. 
A turning point where every Economist will smile and explain the trade magic that meant , we were selling our own products which is a profit to us and buying less supplies or materials to support the economy, the Government started borrowing unnecessarily which we had to repay the loan with high interest. 
In 2015, exports declined to $2525.5 million falling behind imports estimated at $3279.88 same year. 
President John Dramani Mahama’s Consistent borrowing which was NOT wisely used to build factories to produce and create jobs or invested in private sector businesses or solved the energy crisis(dumsor) in 2015 resulted so many existed businesses to run into liquidation. 
Government budget of about GH9.58 billion as interest payment on debt alone which is more than what could raise from external loans and grants of GH8.3 billion is an evidence that, President Mahama and NDC government have failed Ghanaians and may lead the country into a calamitous situation if voted in power for the second term. 
The increase in unemployment rate especially among the youth in the country over the past years is as a result of bad leadership, poor trading policies, corruption and government inability to feel the pain of the individual Ghanaian electorates. 
A government borrowing more should be able to invest in private sector businesses with grants and also build factories to increase production and also create jobs for the graduated youths. Critical analysis shows opposite of what the NDC government is doing and they must be blamed for the country’s crummy economy and depressed businesses. 
Due to high taxes on goods and custom duties on imported and exported supplies in 2016 and local businesses NOT producing and government inability to support private sector businesses , exports declined to $2552.5 million and imports maintaining it’s $3279.88 million this year resulted in the 9% increase of cost of food in September. And yet the government receive praises of poverty alleviation and transforming lives. 
With the above indications, common sense tell us that, Ghana’s economic challenges are not unsolvable nightmares and once the Government put fixes in place to support local businesses and build factories, increasing rate of unemployment will be a thing of the past. 
To solve the problem, Government should invest in building regional market centers along with factories which will effectively increase production, create jobs, increase exportation and decrease importation in order to compete in the international market. 
Even though , foreign investors see Ghana as a good investment destination in terms of political stability and the medium term prospects of the economy but there are yet other significant investment guidelines and support the government should put in place to attract them. A word to the wise is enough.

                            [title] => Redefining ‘Literature’
                            [text] => The Swedish Academy’s Surprise Definition of Literature Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
“By the time he was 23, Bob’s voice, with its weight, its unique, gravelly power was redefining not just what music sounded like, but the message it carried and how it made people feel. Today, everybody from Bruce Springsteen to U2 owes Bob a debt of gratitude” (Barack Obama). 
“Bob Dylan is a genius, and for his genius, he’s been rewarded in every way; with fame, money, acclaim. He deserves all of it, but he doesn’t deserve the Nobel…The objection here hinges in the definition of the word ‘literature.’ You wouldn’t give the literary prize to an economist or a political saint. You shouldn’t give it to Bob Dylan (Stephen Metcalf). 
BOB DYLAN AND THE FACE OF MYSTERY 
The Swedish Academy, which is responsible for selecting Nobel Laureates in Literature, this year, 2016, has nominated Bob Dylan, an American singer, writer, songwriter and musician whose music genres run from folk, rock, gospel, and blues to country, for the prestigious award with the following citation for his: 
“Having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.” 
Already the world of literature is abuzz with a mixture of confusion, excitement, and utter shock. 
The obvious question then becomes: 
Why did the Swedish Academy ignore such great writers from Leo Tolstoy, Chinua Achebe, Arthur Miller, perennial nominee Nuruddin Farah, Mark Twain, Jorge L. Borges, Robert Frost, Henry James, Marcel Proust, James Joyce, Primo Levi, Philip Roth, George Orwell, Vladimir Nabokov, Wystan H. Auden, and Virginia Woolf to John Updike? 
This question is sometimes difficult to answer as information on possible answers is shrouded in mystery in accordance with regulations set forth in motion by the Norwegian Nobel Committee. 
This information is, however, declassified fifty years following the prestigious prize being awarded to a selected nominee. 
A NECESSARY DIVERSION: SOME IMPORTANT POINTS TO TAKE NOTE OF 
Meanwhile, others have speculated that the Swedish Academy is too Eurocentric when it never considered Chinua Achebe for the Prize. 
But this speculation flies in the face of the Prize being given to Toni Morrison, Wole Soyinka, and Derek Walcott. 
We do know for a fact that Henry Louis Gates, Jr. may have played some role in Soyinka’s nomination (a high-profile American academic who is a colleague of both Gates and Soyinka confided in us). 
Significantly, Soyinka has admitted in an interview that his being awarded the 1986 Nobel Prize in Literature may explain some of the tensions between him and Achebe. 
Finally, Nellie Yvonne McKay’s text “Critical Essays on Toni Morrison” brought the work of Toni Morrison to the attention of the Swedish Academy. 
It was actually the Jamaican-American woman of letters who was first offered the position Gates occupies now at Harvard University, a position she turned down and instead asked that it be given to Gates. Gates would later assemble a world-class faculty including Wole Soyinka, he and Appiah’s professor and academic advisor at Cambridge University, Kwame Anthony Appiah, the brilliant Ghanaian writer, historian and editor Emmanuel Acheampong, Cornel West among others. 
Acheampong played an instrumental role in creating the Department of African/African-American Studies. The six-volume “Dictionary of African Biography” is edited by him and Gates. Gates co-authored “The Anthology of African American Literature” and “The Future of the Race” with Nellie and West respectively, and with Appiah edited “The Dictionary of Global Culture” and the first edition of “Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience” (see Molefi Kete Asante’s “Microsoft Encarta Africana Edited by Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Anthony Appiah” for his critique of this latter volume at www.asante.net). 
And, last but not least, it was Soyinka who advised Gates to read literature if he wanted to impact an impact in race relations. His important work “The Signifying Monkey” would revolve around Soyinka’s interpretation of Yoruba culture, cosmology-cosmogony, art, philosophy, history among other useful topics. 
Lastly, Gates then built the department around the progressive ideals and philosophy of America’s pre-eminent urban sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois, a literary giant whose intellectual, moral and social philosophy Appiah tried to deconstruct in his controversial work, “In My Father’s House” (Read: W.E.B. Du Bois at the Hutchins Center). In this book Appiah was also highly critical of Soyinka, his mentor! Also in the late 1990s, for instance, Gates campaigned/lobbied for Du Bois to be named Time Magazine’s Man of the Century! 
BOB DYLAN AND THE SILENT CONTROVERSY 
Essentially, Dylan was not the first musician to be nominated for the prestigious prize. The first was Rabindranath Tagore, a Bengali musician, poet, painter, writer, film composer, and visual artist. The Swedish Academy awarded him the 1913 Nobel Prize in Literature (citation): 
“Because of his profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse, by which, with consummate skill, he has made his poetic thought, expressed in his own English words, a part of the literature of the West.” 
Then also, Alex Lubet, Morse Alumni Distinguished Teaching Professor of Music and Adjunct Professor of American Studies, University of Minnesota, writes of Tagore: 
“The Nobel website states that Tagore, though he wrote in many genres, was principally a poet who published more than 50 volumes of verse, as well as plays, short stories, and novels. Tagore’s music isn’t mentioned until the last sentence, which says that the artist ‘also left… songs for which he wrote the music himself,’ as if this much-loved body of work was no more than an afterthought. 
“But with over 2,000 songs to his name, Tagore’s output of music alone is extremely impressive. Many continue to be used in films, while three of his songs were chosen as national anthems by India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, an unparalleled achievement. 
“Today, Tagore’s significance as a songwriter is undisputed.” 
But Tagore was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature, not for the kind of recognition the Swedish Academy has extended Dylan, although Prof. Lubet draws some striking parallels between the careers of both men. 
That said, Prof. Lubet also cites an unsubstantiated rumor that claims Dylan was “first nominated in 1996” for the Nobel Prize in Literature. 
This implies that the Swedish Academy may have been wrestling with the idea of awarding the Nobel Prize in Literature to Dylan. 
However, we cannot make much of this speculation without the benefit of verifiable supporting evidence. 
It is nevertheless interesting to see how some experts are already drawing some parallels between Dylan’s musical language and the language of Homer’s epic poetry/poetic narrative (see his “Odyssey” and “Iliad”). 
To make the spice up the controversy, others have also gone as far saying the Greek lyric poet Sappho, one of the so-called Nine (Melic) Poets would have endorsed the Swedish Academy for awarding Dylan the prestigious prize were she alive today. 
It is interesting knowing that two Homer scholars, Albert Lord and Milman Parry, demonstrated that the epic poetry of Homer was based on or originated in the oral traditions (or oral lore) of his Greek community, which also means, among other extrapolations, that what later came to be known as “Iliad” and “Odyssey” were, in fact, in oral forms before were collected in book forms. 
There have also been subtle references to the lyric poetry of Ancient Greece. At least not everyone agrees with this characterization (Scott Timberg): 
“And most of Dylan’s lyrics don’t stand up terribly well as poetry…Slate’s Stephen Metcalf makes a well-argued case, which I am at least partially sympathetic to, that his songs aren’t really poetry at all.” 
The above notwithstanding, so far, we have not come to any information where the poetic language of Dylan’s music is compared to Nobel Laureate Derek Walcott’s three-hundred-page-plus “Omeros (1990).” 
Is this prestigious recognition bestowed on Dylan, a raconteur and rhapsodist, on the basis of what the Ugandan scholar, literary theorist, and linguist Pio Zirimu called “orature” (“oral literature”)? Thus far, no controversy has greeted this announcement as it did in the case of President Obama, Henry Kissinger, Wangari Maathai, or Yasser Arafat! 
Whatever the reasons for Dylan’s nomination which we might get to know in fifty years from now (2066) if the Norwegian Nobel Committee does not change or revise its regulations on its classified archives/database, the fact still remains that he is still the 2016 recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature. 
Let us remember that thirty years after Soyinka had been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, the debates still continues in parts of the African world, unabated, why it did not go to Achebe instead, or why Achebe was not awarded one. There were even calls for Soyinka to recommend the Nobel Prize in Literature for his colleague in 2013! Here is Soyinka’s stinging riposte to the callers: 
“Let us quit this indecent exercise of fatuous plaints, including raising hopes, even now, with talk of ‘posthumous’ conferment, when you know damned well that the Nobel committee does not indulge in such tradition. It has gone beyond ‘sickening.’ It is obscene and irreverent. It desecrates memory. 
“This conduct is gross disservice to Chinua Achebe and disrespectful of the life-engrossing occupation known as literature. How did creative valuation descend to such banality? Do these people know what they’re doing—they are inscribing Chinua’s epitaph in the negative mode of thwarted expectations. I find that disgusting.” 
“…What the literary enterprise is about? Was it the Nobel that spurred a young writer, stung by Eurocentric portrayal of African reality, to put pen to paper and produce ‘Things Fall Apart’? 
“Chinua is entitled to better than being escorted to his grave with that monotonous, hypocritical aria of deprivation’s lament, orchestrated by those who, as we say in my part of the world, ‘dye their mourning weeds a deeper indigo than those of the bereaved’. He deserves his peace. Me too! And right now, not posthumously.” 
CONCLUDING THOUGHTS 
“These songs of mine, they’re like mystery plays, the kind that Shakespeare saw when he was growing up. I think you could trace what I do back that far. They were on the fringes then, and I think they’re on the fringes now. And they sound like they’ve been on the hard ground” (Bob Dylan). 
Those of our writers who are aiming for the Nobel Prize in Literature should know henceforth that “literature” means many things to the Swedish Academy. It means more than what one writes, to encompass what and how one writes what one sings (“sheet music”). 
Ironically, unlike Bob Dylan, Wole Soyinka, a musician and guitarist in his own right, fortunately won the prestigious prize not for his maverick musicianship but for his complex narrative literature, drama specifically. The irony, if we should add, is that the Swedish Academy is not even getting any response from Dylan whether or not he is going to formally accept the award. 
Let us not ignore the fact that Dylan is a writer as well. In fact his partially flavored stream-of-consciousness novel, “Tarantula,” reminds us of the works of Ben Okri, Salman Rushdie, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, and a memoir “Chronicles: Volume 1”! 
Those of us who have and been listening to his music know he is a great songwriter with a powerful gravelly voice known for its strong semblance of an eloquent language of lyric poetry.

                            [text] => ATC Ghana Supports Rangoon Camp Junior High and Basic Schools ATC Ghana Donates Science Kits & Equipment to The Exploratory at Rangoon Camp Junior High and Basic Schools Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
Volunteers from ATC Ghana arrived at the Rangoon Camp Junior High School (JHS) for their 2nd Mini CSR initiative for 2016 on 23rd September. This was a special occasion as this is ATC Ghana’s 5th Anniversary and employees generously made voluntary cash donation which was used to purchase story books for the school in addition to the Company’s contributions of science equipment’s and learning materials. 
ATC Ghana presented the donation, in collaboration with The Exploratory, a Ghana-based NGO that aims to make science, technology, engineering and mathematics education, also known as STEM, more relevant, joyful, collaborative and equitable to girls. By this collaborative effort, both organizations anticipate that the students at Rangoon Camp JHS will experience their science lessons in a completely new way this school year and beyond. 
Mr. Alfred Odamey, Head teacher of Rangoon Camp JHS welcomed the volunteers from ATC Ghana and expressed delight about the program. Mrs Sheila Adjin-Tettey ATC Ghana’s Project Manager for this CSR programme formally introduced the students to ATC’s business and encouraged them to study hard and actively participate in the activities for the day. 
Volunteers took the students through reading and communication skills clinic, presentation of information using Microsoft PowerPoint and a discussion on social media and its effects on education. 
“We are happy to complement the exciting and commendable work of The Exploratory by giving students and teachers the learning materials and resources to engage students with STEM in a practical way,” said Letitia Asiedu-Attafuah, Head of Human Resources at ATC Ghana. “ATC takes great pride in our various philanthropic initiatives which are led by our valued employees and this demonstrates our commitment to sustainable initiatives in all our communities”. 
The Rangoon Camp Schools is a government school situated amongst the well-resourced private schools in the Cantonment area. 
This August, four teachers from the Rangoon Camp JHS and Primary Schools joined over 50 teachers from schools in Accra, Pokuase, Nsawam and Berekuso, where The Exploratory’s clubs are held, on a 3-day training. 
“I learnt about electronics, about building anatomical models of the body with simple materials, and how to support the girl-child in learning”, said Mrs. Diana Tetteh, a science teacher at the Rangoon Camp JHS. “It was fun and educative. That’s the spirit that I now want to bring to my students”. 
ATC’s global philanthropic signature program, introduced in 2011, focuses on sponsoring initiatives that improve education through technology. Around the globe, ATC employees are leading projects dedicated to furthering this initiative through partnerships with local schools and organizations. 
“We already have a relationship with the ATC Ghana, where our students visited their offices for a career day in July 2015,” said Mr. Odamey. “The Exploratory brings expertise and inspiration to our teachers and students. We look forward to this partnership developing and to creating a well-resourced STEM lab, so even more students can benefit”. 
“Together, we can nurture the scientists, engineers and technologists of tomorrow that are necessary for Ghana’s development”, Mr. Odamey continued.

                            [text] => Christianity Vs Ghana’s Entertainment The Impact Crew: “Charismatic Witchcraft'' Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
Indeed, this issue has made me suffer from insomnia for sometime now, however, I’m left with no choice than to express my worry about it through words. Religion defined from the psychological point of view by James L. Coz which was put into collection by Ferguson will clearly show that, “it’s the result of seeking comfort in a world which, dispassionately considered, is a kind of terrifying wilderness”. 
For the purpose of clarity and evidence, I’ll limit my argument to the happenings in Christianity in reference to the Ghanaian entertainment setting. From our basic schools, pupils were exposed to the need to look up to some people in the society whom he/she can be used as a roadmap to achieve greatness. Fast forward, the idea of role model was established at that tender age in the hearts of Ghanaian students. Role model are people who have excelled in the various fields and their lives basically serve as a motivation to the upcoming ones. Ghanaians have witnessed an uncountable number of celebrities who have come to spice our television screens from the days of Dr. Kwame Nkrumah till now. However, the issue is that, after misleading the masses to emulate their lifestyle both the ugly and the good, religion becomes the medium where they finally seek refuge at a point when their career has died from the system. 
Ghanaian entertainment industry particularly music has gone through series of revolutions starting from the time of Nana Kwame Ampadu and his African Brothers Band International who took the nation by surprise with the Hi-life genre. With time, a new dimension headed by Nana Acheampong, Lee Duodu, A. B Crentsil among others in the late 80’s with their Borga Hi-life when the 83 hunger struck through the length and breadth of this nation. Charles Kwadwo Fosu, popularly know as Daddy Lumba also took the music baton and gave Ghanaians value for their money whenever he organize music show. Time changes, a new generation of creative minds burst into the music scene and rebranded the genre with fast rhythmic flows and instrumentals which in any day sound good to every listening ears. Reggie Rockstone deserves to be applauded here for being the propagator of hip-life although Gyedu Blay Amboley use to challenge him in terms of the real inventor of this genre. Nonetheless, some artiste like Obrafour, Obour, Okyeame Kwame, Okomfour Kwaadɛɛ, Lord Kenya, K. K Fosu, Ofori Amponsah among others have paid their dues well by blending sense with rhythm in the hip-life music genre. Nowadays, most of the contemporary music artiste in the system are pulling all the crowds and the cash without considering the content in their rap, therefore making less sense as compared to their predecessors. 
As earlier said, the celebrities are to live a life worthy of emulation to be copied by the younger generation. But the story is different in this county. We’ve had so many celebrities who in their hay-days never thought of repenting. They spent all their time and energy organising music shows, clubbing and chasing different shades of women. For the purpose of clarity, I’ll cite Lord Kenya who in the early 2000’s lived a luxurious lifestyle and abused narcotic drugs like cocaine. He tagged himself the rap heavyweight champion and produced hit songs after hit songs in those times. He ruled the rap scene until he decided to give his life to Christ at a point in time when his music career was fading! Why didn’t he repented when he was acclaimed the rap heavyweight in Ghana? Likewise, Ofori Amponsah also burst into the music scene and was labeled the Highlife King who release hits after hits just like his predecessor. As my mum has always been telling me, “all days are not equal”, a time came in the music career of Ofori Amponsah when he wasn’t getting the needed attention as it used to be. He was quick to employ a face saving mechanism by pronouncing his encounter with Jesus Christ. He went further to establish his own church. Sadly, because he wasn’t making money as he used to get as compared to when he was in the “profane” world, he quickly renounced his faith and came back to release another Hi-life track titled alewa (sweet toffee) featuring Sarkodie. This gave him the title “Pastor Alewa” as Ghanaians were trying to make fun of him. The list goes on to include Timothy Bentum, Papa Shee, Yaw Siki, Akoo Nana, Azigizar Jnr, Nii Soul and many others who all run into Christianity at a time when their impact in the Ghanaian Music Industry was of less significance. 
Recently, a crop of music stars are into the system who’re leading the youth into an undesirable path. Notable among them are Sarkodie, Shatta Wale, Stonebwoy, Pappy Kojo, Joey B, Criss Wadle, Opanka and most of the contemporary artistes. Nowadays, the fashion trend in the country is getting crazier each and every day as a result of the “misleading” impact of Pappy Kojo and Joey B in particular. Pappy started to showcase different crazy and tight fitting (pencil-jeans) costumes in his music videos. However, because these people appear constantly on our screens, their impacts are high as most people are tempted to take them as their models. Likewise, Sarkodie and M.anifest also bearded themselves, and within a twinkle of an eye, Ghanaian youths are copying blindly. Dade Opanka on the other side left his hair untrimmed, and fast forward, the youths are initiating such acts. Now the issue is, why won’t they repent at this moment when their music career is strong but wait till their career is fading before they pronounce repentance on themselves? Recently, actor Majid Michel and music director/actor Pascal Amanfo, who’s known for the popular music video titled “kaalu” by E.L are doing the work of God. I asked myself, why now? Why didn’t Majid Michel repent at the time when he was caressing all the beautiful ladies in the movie? Why didn’t he search for salvation at that time, but now that he’s no longer active in the movie scene? 
To pen down my thoughts, I’ve the conviction that the religious people who’ll read this article will attributes everything to God’s appointed time in the life of humanity. However, must it always be the case for people to live their lives anyhow, and when their relevance are no more important, then they try to seek refuge in Christ? I wonder the number of souls who will be lost by the time Sarkodie, Shatta Wale, Stonebwoy and the rest will finally decided to seek for salvation. Most people have go in for tattoo in order to be like their favourite celebrities. Ask yourself, do you know the number of people who have died in their evil ways as a result of imitating Lord Kenya in his hay-days? Sadly, the enthusiasm and the zeal at which Lord Kenya used to do the rap music in the early 2000’s is somehow low as compared to his gospel songs, but the worst of all the Christian converts is Ofori Amponsah affectionately called “Pastor Alewa”. Likewise, Daddy Lumba on his sick bed professed the name of the Lord and even composed a gospel song titled, “Mɛsom Jesus”( I’ll worship Jesus), however, he quickly went back into his formal ways as Ofori Amponsah and Akoo Nana did. If this is the trend, whereby our celebrities decide to use temporal conversion into Christianity as a means of hiding from public disgrace, then there must be something wrong somewhere! It’s my fervent hope that the majority of Ghanaians wish to see their celebrities living a life worthy of emulation devoid of evil. Therefore, if they have it in mind to search for salvation, the time is now. They shouldn’t wait until the time when their careers are fading before coming out publicly to tell us stories of no substance.

                            [text] => World News More Refugees And Migrants Rescued Off Lybian Coast More than 200 People Rescued off Libyan coast Save the Children’s Search and Rescue Vessel Returns from its Latest Mission in Mediterranean Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
Save the Children’s search and rescue ship, the Vos Hestia, is returning to Italy with more than 200 refugees and migrants rescued in two separate operations off the North African coast. Sadly, among them are the bodies of five people who perished before rescuers could reach the first boat in distress. 
“We received a call to assist in the rescue of a wooden boat in distress,” said Gillian Moyes, Save the Children’s team leader on the Vos Hestia. “When we arrived on the scene, five people had already died. The bodies and the survivors were transferred onto our ship from a navy vessel.” 
The Vos Hestia was then called to assist in a second rescue, which took place over several hours at night. In total, more than 200 people were brought on board, including pregnant women, and a large number of lone children and families with children as young as one year old.

“This tragic event once again highlights the dangers faced by those crossing the Mediterranean Sea to seek the safety of Europe,” added Ms. Moyes. 
“So far in 2016, more than 3,600 people have drowned while attempting this treacherous journey. The continuing loss of life clearly shows how search and rescue operations capacity must be a primary focus of the European response to save all lives at risk.” 
Save the Children has provided fresh water, food and blankets to everyone on board. The survivors of the first rescue, in particular, are being assisted by the medical and child protection teams to ensure they receive the specific support they need following such a harrowing event.

As part effort to improve and increase access to education in the Dormaa Central Municipality in the Brong Ahafo region the Assembly over the past four years has been spending millions of Ghana cedis on educational infrastructure. 
The Municipal Chief Executive, Gordon Asubonteng in an exclusive interview noted that construction of classroom blocks, teacher’s bungalows, dining and assembly halls have been the main projects being executed. 
According to him, improving access to quality of education at all levels within the Dormaa Central Municipality has been the main agenda of the assembly under his leadership. 
“More resources have been put into getting 16 classroom blocks for deprived schools in the municipality. Notable among them is a 3-unit classroom block at Sromani Presby Primary school”, he noted. 
This is to complement an existing HIPC funded 3-unit classroom block constructed during former President Kuffour’s reign. 
He said another classroom block is under construction to replace the wooden structure for the Pre-school division of Sromani Presby Primary school. 
The Municipal Chief Executive said the assembly is committed to raising the standard of education within the Doramaa area. 
Mr. Asubonteng however noted that their greatest challenge is reviving projects that have been abandoned over the years which include a 2-storey 12-unit classroom block at Salvation Army Senior High School at Aboabo near Dormaa Ahenkro.

Zambia made the remarks at the just-concluded Africa-week joint debate on New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), focusing on the progress in implementation and international support as well as on the decade to roll back malaria in developing countries, particularly in Africa. 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs Assistant Director (International Organisations), Mr. Eliphas Chinyonga said Zambia welcomed the programme for infrastructure development in Africa that NEPAD developed, focusing on transformative regional projects. 
“Out of the priority Regional Infrastructure projects identified, Zambia is likely to benefit directly from those that are located or pass through the borders. These include Serenje–Nakonde Road with the total length of 614.71km; Lusaka-Lilongwe ICT Terrestrial Fiber Optic; Zambia-Tanzania-Kenya Transmission Line; and Batoka Gorge Hydro Power Project,” said Mr. Chinyonga at the UN General Assembly meeting. “I am pleased to report that Zambia developed a compendium of climate oriented agriculture technologies in all three of its agro ecological regions. This was facilitated through the support from the NEPAD Climate Change Fund for mainstreaming Climate Smart Agriculture into the National Agriculture Investment Plan.” 
He said Zambia is committed to promoting human capital development. 
I am pleased to report that Zambia developed a compendium of climate oriented agriculture technologies in all three of its agro ecological regions 
In this regard, Mr. Chinyonga said Zambia will continue to improve the teaching of science and mathematics, which are critical to attaining improvements in technology and innovation for enhanced industrialisation and job creation. 
Mr. Chinyonga also said Zambia was focusing on reducing malaria related deaths countrywide and hoped to achieve a malaria-free Zambia by 2020. 
Mr. Chinyonga said, so far, malaria prevalence and deaths have steadily decreased, culminating in an impressive 55 percent reduction in all cases of child mortality. 
On gender equality and women empowerment, Mr. Chinyonga informed the global body that Zambia enacted the Gender Equity and Equality Act No. 22 of 2015, which has fully domesticated major international and regional instruments including the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa and the SADC Protocol on Gender and Development. 
However, Mr. Chinyonga expressed Zambia’s concern that the process of integrating NEPAD into the African Union structures and processes has been slow, despite the African Union Commission and the NEPAD Agency working towards concluding the matter. 
“It is our view that international support to facilitate the inclusion of realistic timelines for concluding the matter would be useful,” said Mr. Chinyonga. “Notwithstanding the foregoing, Zambia still remains fully committed to ensuring that the priority areas of energy, industrialisation, intra-regional trade, food security, health, education, gender equality and adaptation to climate change are fast tracked under NEPAD.”

Despite its obligations under international law and repeated agreements between the Government of the Republic of South Sudan and the Government of Sudan to end such support, credible reports continue to indicate the Government of the Republic of South Sudan is harboring and providing assistance to armed Sudanese opposition groups. We urge South Sudan’s leaders to redouble their efforts to meet the commitments they recently reached with Sudan under which both sides agreed to end support for armed opposition groups on either side. 
We also urge both Sudan and South Sudan to fully respect the 2012 Agreement on Security Arrangements 
The presence of Sudanese armed opposition forces in South Sudan, and their involvement in South Sudan’s internal conflicts, destabilizes both Sudan and South Sudan. It is, moreover, a violation of the terms of the Agreement for the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan. We call on the Government of the Republic of South Sudan to ensure Sudanese armed opposition groups are not in a position to conduct armed operations within South Sudan or across the border in Sudan. 
We also urge both Sudan and South Sudan to fully respect the 2012 Agreement on Security Arrangements, and withdraw their armed forces from the Safe Demilitarized Border Zone.

                            [text] => Disqualified Ayariga Called Ec Boss A ‘Liar’ Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
Disqualified Presidential Nominee of the All People’s Congress (APC) Hassan Ayariga has chided the Chairperson of the Electoral Commission Charlotte Osei describing the EC boss as a liar. According to the leader and founder of All People’s Congress, the EC boss has lied about his (Hassan Ayariga’s) qualification and threatened to expose the EC boss. 
“I am a statesman, I contested elections in this country and if she doesn’t know she should find out. I will call an International body to expose her for all that she is. She lied about people’s Identity and their qualifications” 
The Electoral Commission has reported Hassan Ayariga to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) over alleged criminalities he is said to have committed. One of such criminalities has to do with a doctorate degree Hassan Ayariga stated on his presidential nomination form, as being obtained from Great Achievers University of Spain in 2014. But according to the Electoral Commission, checks have revealed that there is no such institution called Great Achievers University in Spain that awards PhD in political science, but rather there is Great Achievers International Theological Seminary which has nothing to do with political science. But Hassan Ayariga insisted that all information provided on his nomination form were accurate and verifiable. He told Bright Kwesi Asempa the host of Onua Fm morning Show ‘Ye Sempa’ that “I have my degree from Great Achievers University, will I award myself a degree, who say I need a degree to become president. It was because there was not enough space of the form given me by EC that was why I shortened the name of the School, EC should have provided more space, how does that become my fault” NO EXPERIENCE Hassan Ayariga also described the chairperson of the Electoral Commission Charlotte Osei as inexperience, wondering why the President before appointing her did not find it expedient to have Dr Kwadwo Afari-Gyan, the former EC boss to disciple her. “What was her performance at her former post the NCCE. If she had done a good job there, she would have known that I contested in the 2012 elections and also there would not be huge number of spoilt ballot papers” He reiterated that if the present EC boss is as qualified as people think, she would not disqualify smaller parties and protect the bigger parties. “Did she find out how many offices both CPP and Independent candidate Jacob Osei Yeboah have across the country, yet she shepherded them” By Bright dzakah/NewsGhana.com.gh Do you have more to share about this story - photos or video etc - you can send them to: (newsghana101@gmail.com) TAGS

                            [text] => Losing Aquatic Matter Through Sand Winning in Coastal Areas ‘Winning The Sand And Losing Fisheries’-A Growing Coastal Belt Problem In Ghana Oct 21, 2016 tweet 
For decades sand wining and gravel extraction have become prevalent along the coast, where fishing is predominant. The combined effect of the sand winning and stone extraction is resulting in the degradation of vast farmlands and accordingly putting pressure on poor rural farmers who are already vulnerable. 
Eventually the practice results in floods, and destruction of turtles’ nestling grounds which is unfriendly to fishing and tourism, together with destruction of landing bases thereby reducing communities’ economic avenues and district assemblies’ revenue potential and ecosystem along the river banks. 
As a result, the depth of rivers or sea reduce(s) drastically over the years due to silt which has incapacitated its water holding ability. Fisherfolks have complained about the problem, which affect their livelihoods. 
Interacting with some fish processors at Kokrobite revealed that the problem persists and getting out of hand. Many of them have complained to the appropriate authority at the local level, via the district assembly but measures adopted by the assembly seem not solve the address. 
The perpetrators of the act according to the women, usually do this at night when no one is available to guard the sea or even see them. Some of the women says many of them have tripped as a result of the act sustaining various injuries. In addition, the women complained about the disappearance of sea turtles, which they linked to the activities of sand winning. A District President for the National Fish Processors and Traders Association (NAFPTA), Grace Bondzie says sand winning has come down drastically, adding, these days it is hard to find people doing that. 
“We did campaign on sand winning by informing people if they are seen doing it, they will be arrested by the police and that fear has led to the low patronage. If we can have that on consistent basis it will lead to disappearance of sand winning,” Bondzie states. She laments that another problem confronting the beach is pollution which manifests in the form of plastics, faecal, among others that is posing serious health concern to marine biodiversity. The legal or institutional framework under which sand winning takes place in Ghana and the Ga districts in particular is defined by the following laws–the Minerals and Mining Law PNDCL 153, as amended by Act 475, Small Scale Mining Law PNDCL 218, Sand Winning and Stone Quarrying Bye-Laws and Environmental Assessment Regulations Law LI 1652. Four main organizations, the Minerals Commission, the Mines Department, the Environmental Protection Agency and the District Assemblies are tasked with the enforcement and monitoring of these laws through different roles they play in the districts. 
Sand winning or mining will not directly affect fish stock unless it is somehow affecting unique habitat and causing erosion, destruction of mangroves, nursery grounds, and reproduction grounds essential for fish, says Brian Crawford, the Chief of Party of the USAID/Ghana Sustainable Fisheries Management Project (SFMP). 
“One of the biggest problems of sand mining is the increment of coastal erosion that we have seen along Ghana’s coast line, like Ada, Keta, regions and at the mouth of the Volta River where many places along the beach are eroding rather than accruing. 
“Along the coastal belt, a lot of the coastal lines are being lost to shore lines, while at the same time the shore line is retreating inland. In addition, many of the shore line is getting further of the shore,” he states. 
According to Crawford, whenever people along the coast engage in sand mining that paves way for sediments to be carried along the shore line through wave action eventually leading to erosion of beaches in the country. 
He says that even though sand can be carried from places where excess sand abounds, to places which are experiencing deficits that also comes with its associated problems.“When sand budgeting is done to correct the problem of sand mining in an effort to maintain beaches, it also leaves room for less sand at some point which worsen coastal erosion in areas that are already naturally eroding the coast lines. 
“So that is why there is lots of concern that sand mining should be either banned or regulated in a way that is not impacting on coastal erosion particularly in rivers and along the beaches where eroding shore lines are going to be eroding faster which puts public infrastructure at risk, ” Crawford explains. 
What happens is that whenever storm waves associated with high tides occurs, that results in significant flooding which brings about loss of lives and property, leading to huge financial burden on individuals, families and the government. 
So one of the things that the SFMP is doing particularly in the western and central regions is working with town and country planning department to incorporate into their spatial planning elements that look at the unique dynamics of the coastal zone–that these are not stable shorelines, they move, some grow and some gets less over time. 
Crawford points out that it is crucial for any spatial planning being done to take into consideration sediments and public infrastructure, thus areas which records high erosion rates need to be as designated as no build zones to protect lives and property. 
“If you don’t do this what happens is that then government being asked to build costly shoreline protection works by putting up rocks on the shore line or other techniques to stop coastal erosion by spending millions of dollars and even more in terms cedis,” he states. #“These problems are going to get worse in the future because of sea level rise being caused by global warming and as the planet warms up the ocean warms up, and as water warms up, it expands,” Crawford adds. 
The sea level rise will continue and might even get worse as a result of carbon emission and greenhouses gases, the burning of forests, fossil fuels at levels that are unprecedented in the history of the world. 
There are a lot of mangrove destruction which people use it for fire wood, and building purposes, which is also a concern. 
Mangrove serves as carbon sink to global warming, that is another reason it will be important to maintain mangrove because that helps to sequester carbon in the ground, keep it in the wood and not in the atmosphere and that ultimately help prevent greater global warming. The mangrove are central fish habitat and one thing people often think is they are breeding ground, but the mangrove are generally nursery grounds where a lot of small baby fish reside and provides a lot of protection because of the roots and mangrove provide a lot of food and protection for the juvenile fish. 
“So as they grow up and gets bigger a lot of the juvenile fish that live in the estuaries, lagoons, and rivers around the mangrove areas get bigger. 
“Some of them will stay in the estuary area, while many will then migrate into the ocean. So it is very important that we try to maintain those mangrove because that helps to protect the juvenile fishes for them to grow up and reproduce and provide the next generation,” he adds. Adult sea turtles spend all their lives at sea and come unto shore to lay eggs in the sand along the beaches. 
“So if erosion is occurring and we are losing sandy beaches that are central habitat to maintain sea turtles population then it becomes a problem to sea turtles to lay eggs.“If there are not any sandy beaches that has the characteristics that are needed then they can’t lay their eggs and if they can’t lay their eggs, there is no next generation of sea turtles that we can find in the ocean. Sand wining can also have some significance in their natural habitat or nursing grounds for sea turtles,” Crawford says. 
Women groups, fishermen can play a role by not engaging in sand winning themselves and if they see that occurring they need to contact local authorities who should be taking enforcement actions against those who are doing it which is probably illegal in the first place.“The question is, do they have permit and if they don’t have permit they shouldn’t be sand winning. If permits are being provided we should make sure that permits are not provided for sand winning in areas where it will increase coastal erosion problems, because you make money from the permits in the short term but then you are going to spend greatly in the long term to protect the shoreline,” he emphasises. 
The project manager of the DAA, Mr Abraham Asare, says sand winning is one of the biggest problem in most of the landing sites or fishing communities in Ghana. According to him, most of the people in the communities such as Kokrobite fetch the sand to make concrete blocks. 
“In communities where the chiefs and people have ban the practice, you still have people doing this in the night, by fetching with bucket and trucks to make blocks for construction of houses. It is not a good practice, but because they fetch it in bit, they don’t see the effects of it,” said Mr Asare. 
Mr Asare states that any sand fetched has an effect on the landing site or beach, where the sea gradually starts eroding and becomes a problem and it is not only in Kokrobite but across all coastal belts of Ghana. 
“The number of blocks that has been manufactured and still packed at the landing beaches, was huge upon a visit to Apam recently. 
“Through interactions with the local people it was revealed that people contract others to fetch the sand for them and lay the blocks right at the landing beaches. I could count about 200,000 sandcrete blocks for buildings packed along the beach in Apam alone. 
“It appears they do not see any problem with what they are doing and I have been told that the chief fishermen have ban such practice but the enforcement is a problem,” he notes. The Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development, Ms Sherry Ayittey, also says local government officials are the ones that give the permit for people to engage in sand winning.“Apart from that it is being done illegally by the fishermen themselves. In the night trucks come and collect the sand. The local government are the ones to implement the buffer policy that says there should be no activity within 50 metres from the water to protect the beach,” the minister notes.
